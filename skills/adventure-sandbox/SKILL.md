# The Dimmark — West Marches Sandbox

A frontier sandbox adventure for Torchlit. Designed for level 1-4 characters in a West Marches-style campaign where the party chooses where to go and what to do. Emphasizes exploration, resource scarcity, and the ever-present threat of darkness.

## Regional Overview

The Dimmark is a stretch of untamed wilderness at the ragged edge of civilization, where the ruins of older worlds press up against the living dark. To the north, volcanic ridges smolder beneath perpetual storm clouds. To the east, the land slopes down toward the Sunless Sea, a vast subterranean ocean whose black shores swallow the light. To the south and west, forests and swamps choke the lowlands, ancient and hostile.

**Theme:** Gothic horror meets treasure hunt. The darkness itself is the real enemy — torches gutter, lanterns fail, and what lives in the black spaces between the ruins is older than memory. Every expedition is a gamble: push deeper for greater rewards, or turn back before the light runs out.

**Tone:** Resource scarcity defines life here. Torches are currency. Iron is precious. Food spoils. The frontier settlement of The Wick survives because it controls the last reliable light source for miles — a decommissioned beacon tower whose glow keeps the worst of the dark at bay. Beyond its circle, anything goes.

**The Old World:** Ruins dot the Dimmark — shattered keeps, flooded mines, crumbling shrines to forgotten gods. Something catastrophic happened here long ago. The land remembers it in the form of warped stone, cursed ground, and things that should not still be moving. Scholars call it the Unraveling. Nobody agrees on what caused it.

**The Living Dark:** Darkness in the Dimmark is not merely the absence of light. It has weight. It has hunger. Torches burn faster underground. Lantern oil thickens. Magical light attracts attention. The creatures that thrive here have adapted: echolocation, thermal vision, bioluminescence used as lure. Light is survival. Darkness is death.

**Current Situation:** Adventurers have been arriving at The Wick in increasing numbers, drawn by rumors of treasure in the ruins and bounties posted by the Reeve. The settlement needs trade routes secured, threats eliminated, and the surrounding hexes mapped. The Wick pays for information, pays more for proof of cleared dangers, and pays most for recovered artifacts from the old world.

---

## Home Base: The Wick

**Population:** ~200 (humans, Ironborn, a handful of Faekin and Duskfolk)
**Danger Level:** Safe (within the beacon's light radius)

A frontier settlement built around a decommissioned beacon tower at the very edge of explored territory. The tower's ancient crystal still glows faintly — enough to keep the worst creatures at bay within a quarter-mile radius. Beyond that circle, The Wick is just another cluster of buildings in the dark.

The settlement is a rough collection of timber-and-stone buildings arranged in concentric rings around the tower. The inner ring holds essential services. The outer ring holds residences, animal pens, and storage. A wooden palisade with iron-banded gates marks the boundary. Guards walk the wall with torches at all hours.

### The Tallow (Tavern & Inn)

Run by **Marta** (50, Human, stern, practical, missing three fingers on her left hand — lost to frostbite, not combat, though she lets people assume otherwise). The Tallow is the social heart of The Wick: part tavern, part hiring hall, part post office. Marta keeps order with a heavy hand and a heavier iron ladle.

- **Common room bed:** 5 SP/night (straw pallet, shared room with 8 others)
- **Private room:** 2 GP/night (lockable door, actual mattress, candle stub)
- **Hot meal:** 3 SP (stew of whatever Marta has, bread, weak ale)
- **Strong drink:** 5 SP (homebrewed spirits, burns going down)
- **Rumors:** Buy a round for the house (2 GP) for 1d3 rumors from the rumor table
- **Message board:** Notes pinned behind the bar from travelers, merchants, and the desperate

### Greer's Provisions (General Store)

Run by **Greer** (40, Human, cheerful, round-faced, overcharges strangers by 20% until they have done at least one favor for the settlement). Greer controls the only reliable supply of torches, rope, rations, and basic gear in the region. He knows it. Prices reflect scarcity, not greed — mostly.

- **Torch (6-pack):** 1 GP (standard price is 5 SP; scarcity markup)
- **Lantern oil (1 flask):** 2 GP
- **Iron rations (1 week):** 5 GP
- **Hemp rope (50'):** 3 GP
- **Iron spikes (12):** 2 GP
- **Chalk (10 sticks):** 5 SP
- **Healing poultice:** 10 GP (restores 1d4 HP, Greer makes them himself, limited stock of 1d4 available per week)
- **No magic items, no enchanted gear, no scrolls.** If it glows, it came from the ruins, not a shop shelf.
- **Gear repair:** 50% of item's base price

### The Forge

Run by **Dag** (55, Ironborn, quiet, builds to last). Dag is the only competent smith within three days' travel. He does not rush. He does not haggle. He does not make small talk. His work is excellent.

- **Weapon repair:** 25% of weapon's base price, ready next day
- **Armor repair:** 50% of armor's base price, ready in 1d3 days
- **Custom work:** Dag will forge specialty items if given rare materials (e.g., nechrome steel, volcanic glass). Prices negotiated per job.
- **Ammunition:** arrows (1 GP/12), bolts (1 GP/12), sling bullets (5 SP/20)

### The Shrine

Tended by **Warden Eska** (30, Duskfolk, idealistic, nervous). A multi-faith shrine built from salvaged stone, honoring no single god but offering space for all. Eska is a trained Warden who came to the frontier to do good and is quietly terrified of everything beyond the palisade.

- **Blessing:** 5 GP donation for a minor blessing (+1 to a single save within the next 24 hours)
- **Healing:** Eska can treat injuries (1d6+1 HP restored, once per character per day, 10 GP donation)
- **Funeral rites:** 2 GP (Eska takes this duty very seriously)
- **Cure disease/poison:** Eska lacks the skill; characters must find other means

### The Bounty Board

Posted outside The Tallow, updated weekly by the Reeve. Bounties range from 10 GP (confirm what is in a nearby hex) to 500 GP (eliminate a confirmed major threat). The board is the primary quest-giver for sandbox play.

**Standing Bounties:**
- Map an unexplored hex: 10 GP (requires physical description, terrain, landmarks)
- Clear a hex of its primary threat: 50-200 GP (proof required — head, trophy, witness)
- Recover an Old World artifact: 100-1,000 GP (appraised by Greer or the Reeve)
- Escort a merchant caravan to the next settlement: 25 GP/person
- Locate a missing person: 50 GP (dead or alive; bonus for alive)

### The Reeve

**Aldric** (60, Human, former soldier, pragmatic). Aldric runs The Wick with a soldier's efficiency and a survivor's ruthlessness. He was part of the original expedition that founded the settlement fifteen years ago. He has seen every kind of frontier horror and no longer flinches. He pays fairly, judges quickly, and does not suffer fools.

- Aldric sets bounties, arbitrates disputes, and controls the settlement's modest treasury
- He has a map of the region with known hexes filled in (party can view but not copy without permission)
- He knows more than he lets on about the Old World ruins but will not share freely — earn his trust first
- **Aldric's Rule:** No one leaves The Wick after dark without the Reeve's permission. Violators are not rescued.

## Hex Map Reference

The Dimmark is mapped as a 7x5 grid of 6-mile hexes. Columns run 01-07 (west to east), rows run 01-05 (north to south).

### Travel Times

| Terrain | Time per Hex | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Road | 4 hours | Well-maintained trade path |
| Grassland | 6 hours | Open terrain, good visibility |
| Forest | 8 hours | Dense canopy, limited sightlines |
| Hills | 8 hours | Elevation gain, rocky terrain |
| Swamp | 10 hours | Waterlogged, sucking mud, disease risk |
| Mountains | 12 hours | Steep, exposed, altitude sickness possible |
| Ruins | 8 hours | Unstable ground, structural hazards |

**Forced march:** Halve travel time but make a CON check on arrival. Failure = 1 level of exhaustion.
**Night travel:** Double travel time. Random encounter checks every 2 hours instead of every 4.

### Fog of War

Hexes start **undiscovered**. Terrain type is unknown until revealed by:
- Traveling into or through the hex
- Observing from high ground (reveals terrain type of adjacent hexes, not features)
- NPC rumors (may reveal terrain type and/or feature, reliability varies)
- Found maps (rare, often incomplete or outdated)

## Quickstart Dungeon: Ashfall Mine

**Location:** Hex 0201 (Hills, Risky)
**Danger Level:** Risky (random encounter check every 2 crawling rounds)
**Theme:** An abandoned iron mine that broke into something older underneath
**Designed For:** Level 1 characters, completable in one session
**Light:** Total darkness throughout unless noted

### Background

The Ashfall Mine operated for three decades, supplying The Wick with iron ore. Six months ago, miners broke through a natural rock wall into a network of ancient tunnels. Two miners disappeared. Then three more. The foreman sealed the lower tunnels, but something had already gotten in. The mine was abandoned within a week. The Reeve posted a bounty: 50 GP to clear the mine and determine what happened, plus 100 GP for any recovered ore or equipment.

### Environment

- **Ceilings:** 8 feet in mine tunnels, 15-20 feet in natural caverns
- **Walls:** Timber-shored mine tunnels (upper), raw limestone caverns (lower)
- **Air:** Dusty in upper mine, damp and mineral-sharp in lower caverns
- **Sounds:** Dripping water, distant echoes, occasional grinding stone
- **Temperature:** Cool in mine tunnels, warm near the deep stair (geothermal)

### Random Encounters (1d6)

Roll every 2 crawling rounds:

| d6 | Encounter |
|----|-----------|
| 1 | 1d4 giant rats (scavenging for food, flee if outnumbered) |
| 2 | 1 Cavern Stalker (hunting from ceiling, drops on last party member) |
| 3 | 2d4 bats (non-hostile swarm, extinguish unprotected flames) |
| 4 | Distant rumbling (structural settling, no danger, but unnerving) |
| 5 | 1d3 skeletons (reanimated miners, still holding tools) |
| 6 | Cold draft from below (torches flicker, -10' light radius for 1 turn) |

### Room Key

#### 1. Mine Entrance

**Connections:** South to Room 2, old cart tracks visible

A timber-framed arch marks the mine entrance, half-collapsed on the right side. Rusted iron cart tracks run into the darkness. A cold draft pushes steadily outward, carrying the smell of damp stone and something faintly metallic. Broken lanterns hang from iron hooks on the support beams. A faded sign reads: "ASHFALL MINE — NO NAKED FLAMES PAST MARKER 6."

- **Hazard:** The right support beam is cracked. Loud noise or impact (combat, explosions) has a 2-in-6 chance of collapsing the entrance (1d6 damage, save to avoid being trapped — 1 turn to dig out)
- **Treasure:** None
- **Secret:** Carved into the left beam, barely visible: tally marks. 47 marks, then a jagged slash through the last five. The foreman's count of days since the breakthrough.

#### 2. Flooded Shaft

**Connections:** North to Room 1, East to Room 3, South to Room 4

The tunnel slopes downward into knee-deep murky water that smells of rust and rot. Rat nests crowd the higher ground along the walls — matted fur, bones, and shredded cloth. Old mining tools lie scattered in the water: pickaxes, shovels, a wheelbarrow on its side. The water is cold and still.

- **Creatures:** 2d4 giant rats nest here. They attack only if their nests are disturbed or the party lingers more than 2 turns.
- **Hazard:** Moving through knee-deep water is noisy. Random encounter checks in adjacent rooms are made at +1 (easier to trigger).
- **Treasure:** A miner's leather satchel wedged behind a support beam, above waterline. Contains: 12 SP, a steel hand mirror, and a sketch of a woman labeled "Lila — come home."
- **Secret:** The wheelbarrow conceals a sealed tin box (requires STR check to pry open): 6 sticks of blasting powder (treat as grenades, 2d6 in 10' radius, extremely dangerous near structural supports).

#### 3. Foreman's Office

**Connections:** West to Room 2

A small dry room cut into the rock, elevated above the water level. Timber door (swollen shut, STR check to force). Inside: a heavy oak desk, an iron lockbox, a cot with a moth-eaten blanket, and a lantern with oil still in it.

- **Creatures:** None
- **Treasure:** The iron lockbox is locked (pick lock or force with STR check at -2). Contains: 35 GP (payroll), a silver pocket watch (15 GP), and a vial of antitoxin.
- **Secret:** The desk drawer contains the foreman's journal. Final entries:

> *Day 41 — Boys hit a crack in the east wall of shaft 4. Cold air pouring through. Smells wrong. Old.*
>
> *Day 43 — Sent Gregor and Tam to explore. They found tunnels. Old ones. Not natural, not mined. Something carved them.*
>
> *Day 45 — Gregor is missing. Tam came back but won't speak. Stares at the wall. I'm sealing the crack tomorrow.*
>
> *Day 47 — Three more gone in the night. No screams. Just gone. We're leaving. Whatever is down there, it can keep the iron.*

#### 4. The Crack

**Connections:** North to Room 2, South to Room 5 (natural fissure), East to Room 6

A jagged fissure in the mine wall, roughly four feet wide and seven feet tall. The timber shoring around it has been torn away — from the inside. Beyond the crack, the architecture changes: no more straight tunnels and timber supports. Instead, smooth-walled passages that curve organically, as if carved by water or something that moved like water. The stone here is darker, veined with a faint mineral glitter.

- **Hazard:** The edges of the crack are sharp volcanic glass. Squeezing through without caution: 1d4 slashing damage. Stating caution: no damage but costs 1 extra turn.
- **Creatures:** None, but scratching sounds echo from below
- **Treasure:** None
- **Secret:** The glittering veins in the stone are trace deposits of nechrome — star-metal from the Old World. Worthless in this quantity, but a sign that deeper tunnels may hold workable deposits (major treasure, worth reporting to the Reeve or Dag).

#### 5. Fungal Cavern

**Connections:** North to Room 4, South to Room 7, Down to Room 8

A natural cavern, 30 feet across, ceiling lost in darkness above. Clusters of bioluminescent mushrooms grow from the walls and floor, casting a sickly blue-green glow (dim light, 15' radius). The air is thick with spores. The floor is spongy with fungal growth.

- **Creatures:** 1 Cavern Stalker clings to the ceiling directly above the largest mushroom cluster. It attacks when a character moves beneath it, dropping with surprise on a 3-in-6. See bestiary skill for stat block.
- **Hazard:** The spores are mildly toxic. Spending more than 3 turns in this room without covering mouth/nose: CON check or suffer -1 to all rolls for 1d6 hours (dizzy, nauseous).
- **Treasure:** Among the mushroom clusters: a dead miner's body (Gregor, from the journal). His pack contains: 8 SP, a silver ring (5 GP), and a crude map scratched on leather showing rooms 1-4 of the mine with an arrow pointing south labeled "DON'T."
- **Secret:** Some of the mushrooms are edible and restorative. A character with herbalism knowledge (INT check) can harvest 1d4 doses of cave moss salve (heals 1d4 HP when applied to wounds). They rot in 3 days.

#### 6. Underground Stream

**Connections:** West to Room 4, East to Room 9

A fast-flowing underground stream cuts through a low-ceilinged passage. The water is clear and bitterly cold, knee-deep at the edges and waist-deep in the center. Smooth stepping stones cross the stream in a line, but several are slick with algae.

- **Creatures:** None
- **Hazard:** Crossing the stepping stones requires a DEX check. Failure: character slips into the stream. The current is strong — STR check to avoid being swept 30 feet downstream into a rocky grotto (1d6 damage from impact).
- **Treasure:** Submerged in a deep pool at the base of a rock formation: a locked iron chest (visible with a light source, requires diving to reach). Contains: 60 GP in mixed coins, a silver dagger (15 GP), and a **Glowstone** (fist-sized crystal that emits dim light in a 10' radius when squeezed, lasts 8 hours per day, recharges at dawn).
- **Secret:** The water is safe to drink and exceptionally pure. Filling waterskins here counts as a fresh water source (relevant for long expeditions).

#### 7. Bone Chamber

**Connections:** North to Room 5, East to Room 10

An ancient burial niche predating the mine by centuries. Alcoves line the walls, each containing skeletal remains wrapped in rotted cloth. The bones are arranged with care — arms crossed, skulls facing east. Faded symbols are painted above each alcove in a pigment that still faintly glows: spirals, crescents, open eyes.

- **Creatures:** Disturbing any bones causes 1d4+1 skeletons to animate. They fight with ancient bronze weapons (1d6 damage). If the party leaves the remains alone, nothing happens.
- **Hazard:** The painted symbols are Old World ward-marks. A character who can read ancient languages (INT check at -2) recognizes them as warnings: "The sleepers below must not wake."
- **Treasure:** One alcove contains a skeleton clutching a bronze amulet set with a pale blue stone. **Sleeper's Amulet** (wear to gain advantage on saves vs. sleep, charm, and fear effects while underground; the amulet grows warm when undead are within 30').
- **Secret:** Behind the deepest alcove, hidden by a stone slab (STR check to move): a narrow passage leading to Room 8.

#### 8. The Altar

**Connections:** Up from Room 5, West from Room 7 (secret), South to Room 10

A circular chamber with a domed ceiling, 20 feet in diameter. In the center stands a stone altar carved from a single block of dark basalt. Its surface is covered in spiral carvings that seem to shift in torchlight. A faint hum fills the room — felt more than heard.

Above the altar, clinging to the domed ceiling in a leathery mass: a Shroudwing nest. Two Shroudwings hang motionless, wrapped in their own wings. They drop and attack if the altar is touched or if bright light is brought within 5 feet.

- **Creatures:** 2 Shroudwings. See bestiary skill for stat block.
- **Treasure:** On the altar: a tarnished silver chalice (25 GP) and a **Voidglass Lens** (monocle-sized disc of black glass; look through it to see invisible creatures and hidden doors within 15' — but while looking through it, the user cannot see anything in normal light).
- **Secret:** Pressing both palms flat against the altar and speaking any word causes the spirals to glow briefly. The character feels a surge of warmth and recovers 1d6 HP. This works once per character, ever. After use, the spirals go dark for that character permanently.

#### 9. Collapsed Gallery

**Connections:** West to Room 6, South to Room 10

A wide gallery that once connected deeper mine shafts, now choked with rubble from a ceiling collapse. Dust hangs in the air. Wooden beams jut from the debris at odd angles. The silence here is oppressive.

- **Creatures:** The ghost of a trapped miner (Tam, from the journal) manifests as a flickering blue shape near the largest rubble pile. He does not attack. He points repeatedly at a specific spot in the rubble and mouths words: "Still here. Still here." If the rubble is cleared (2 turns of work, or faster with blasting powder — risky), his body is found beneath with his treasure. Once his body is recovered, the ghost fades.
- **Hazard:** Clearing rubble is noisy. Automatic random encounter check. Using blasting powder: clears rubble instantly but triggers a secondary collapse (everyone in the room: save or 2d6 damage).
- **Treasure:** On Tam's body: 15 GP, a steel hand axe, and a **Miner's Charm** (iron pendant shaped like a pickaxe; while worn, the bearer can sense structural instability — the GM warns the player before entering rooms with collapse hazards).
- **Secret:** Beyond the rubble, a continuation of the gallery extends south toward Room 10.

#### 10. The Deep Stair

**Connections:** North to Room 8, North to Room 9, West to Room 7

The largest chamber in the complex, 40 feet across with a vaulted ceiling 25 feet high. In the center of the floor: a spiral staircase carved directly into the bedrock, descending into absolute darkness. The stairs are wide enough for two abreast, the steps worn smooth by countless feet over centuries. Warm air rises from below, carrying a faint sulfurous smell. The walls around the stairwell are covered in Old World carvings: armies marching, cities burning, a great darkness swallowing the sun.

At the top of the staircase, blocking descent: a **Tunnel Hulk**. It has made this chamber its lair. Bones, ore chunks, and shiny debris are piled around the stairwell in a crude nest.

- **Creatures:** 1 Tunnel Hulk (boss encounter). See bestiary skill for stat block. It fights to the death to defend its nest.
- **Hazard:** The staircase descends beyond the scope of this adventure — it leads to deeper Old World ruins. The Reeve will pay 200 GP for confirmed report of the staircase's existence and its depth.
- **Treasure:** In the Tunnel Hulk's nest: 87 GP in scattered coins, 3 chunks of raw iron ore (10 GP each to Dag), a **Sunforged Blade** (short sword, +1 to hit and damage, blade glows with warm amber light equivalent to a torch — cannot be extinguished except by sheathing; originally forged to fight creatures of the dark).
- **Secret:** The carvings on the walls depict the Unraveling — the catastrophe that ended the Old World. A character who studies them for 1 turn and succeeds on an INT check learns: "The darkness came from below. They sealed the stairs. They thought it would be enough."

## The Obsidian Keep

An adventure for level 2-4, playable in several sessions. Emphasizes exploration, mystery-solving, and social encounters, with opportunities for combat (always risky).

**Location:** The Obsidian Keep sits on Isla Cineria, a volcanic island in the Sunless Sea. Access via hex 0503 (The Sunless Shore), then by boat to hex 0603. The island is roughly three miles long. The Keep dominates the eastern promontory, visible from the beach as a black spire against the perpetual storm clouds.

### Background

On the subterranean shores of the Sunless Sea stands the holy city of Radiant Vitelis. In the center of the sea lies Isla Cineria, where the lords of the Obsidian Keep harass passing ships with their magics. Duchess Forza mastered sorcery. Her husband Duke Avito grew jealous of her power.

One year ago, the Archbishop of Radiant Vitelis secretly sent the red priests of Vermesh to seduce and corrupt Duke Avito. Two weeks ago, the Archbishop sent a fleet of holy warships to destroy the Obsidian Keep. The fleet never returned.

During the attack, Duke Avito sacrificed his youngest daughter Bianca to summon the immortal horror Vermesh. The half-completed ritual caused a "red storm" of Chaos energy, destroying the fleet and devastating the Obsidian Keep. The Duke fumbled the knife and Vermesh bit off his arm (fatal). Bianca was left in limbo with a crystal knife in her heart.

**Today:** Shattered fleet in the harbor. Survivors huddle on the beach. Inside the Keep, a nightmare of mutations, chaos, and undeath. Duchess Forza lies mostly dead. Duke Avito is entirely dead. Vermesh lurks ethereally, waiting to complete the ritual.

### Adventure Hooks

1. **Archbishop's Call** (Lawful): Sail to Isla Cineria and learn the fate of the fleet. Rewards for saving sailors (50 GP each), recovering relics (500 GP each), and proof that Duke Avito and Duchess Forza are dead (5,000 GP each).
2. **Treasure Hunter** (Chaotic): Master Argento wants treasure hunters to recover valuables. Rewards for eye witnesses (25 GP each), weapons (250 GP each), Obsidian Keep rarities (1,000 GP each), items belonging to the Duke/Duchess (5,000 GP each).

**If Vermesh is defeated**: Chaos fades. Monsters retreat. Lovely horrors weaken. Survivors beg passage to mainland. Obsidian Keep stands empty until another cult or pirates move in.

**If either princess survives**: They take up a lifelong pilgrimage bolstering Law and opposing Chaos. Their exploits become legendary.

**In any case**: The Archbishop uses the tragedy to keep the people faithful and subservient.

| 2 | Undead patrol (2d4 skeletons). Marching in formation, following an ancient route. Ignore the party unless attacked or blocked. Destroying all of them reveals: 1d20 GP in corroded coins and a fragment of an Old World map. |
| 3 | Structural collapse. Floor/wall/ceiling gives way. DEX check or 2d6 damage. Reveals: 1d4: 1=hidden room (small, empty), 2=buried chest (locked, 30 GP), 3=tunnel to lower level, 4=nothing but rubble. |
| 4 | Shroudwing (1). Nesting in rafters/ceiling. Drops onto light sources to extinguish them. See bestiary skill for stat block. |
| 5 | Old World mechanism. Gears, levers, pipes. Still partially functional. INT check to operate: 1d4: 1=opens a sealed door nearby, 2=activates a light source (lasts 1d6 hours), 3=triggers a trap (poison darts, 1d6), 4=does nothing visible (actually signals something deeper). |
| 6 | Cursed ground. Unease, whispers at edge of hearing. WIS check or -1 to all rolls while in the area. Spending a full turn praying or performing a cleansing ritual removes the effect. Source: unburied dead in a shallow pit nearby. Burying them properly ends the curse permanently. |
| 7 | Territorial creature. 1d4: 1=Rockfang, 2=Bloodwing pair, 3=giant spider, 4=Cavern Stalker. Has claimed this ruin as its lair. Fights to defend territory but will not pursue more than 100' from lair. |
| 8 | Intact chamber. Miraculously undamaged room. Contains: furniture, books (mostly ruined), and one intact item of value: 1d4: 1=silver candelabra (50 GP), 2=Old World painting (100 GP to a collector), 3=sealed bottle of ancient spirits (25 GP, or drink for +2 to CHA checks for 1 hour), 4=journal describing the Unraveling in personal terms (valuable to scholars, 200 GP). |

## Faction Summary

### The Wick Settlement
- **Leader:** Reeve Aldric
- **Goals:** Survive, expand, secure trade routes, map the frontier
- **Disposition toward PCs:** Cautiously positive. PCs are useful but expendable. Aldric pays fairly and remembers loyalty. Betray the settlement's trust and you will not be welcome.
- **Relations:** Hostile to bandits. Wary of the Red Priests (unaware of their existence unless PCs report). Neutral toward the Ducal Family (legends, not real threats). Unaware of the Lovely Horrors.

### The Red Priests of Vermesh
- **Leader:** No formal leader; Sycorax (Dragon Suite, Area 37) is the most ambitious. Godric, Harlow, and Ravenna (Duke Avito's Room, Area 54) are the most dangerous.
- **Goals:** Complete the ritual to summon Vermesh into full reality. Spread Chaos.
- **Disposition toward PCs:** Hostile. View outsiders as either sacrifices or obstacles. Will attempt to manipulate before resorting to violence. Offer "gifts" that are always cursed or corrupted.
- **Relations:** Enemies of the Ducal Family (especially Princess Viola, who is actively hunting them). Use the Lovely Horrors as unwitting shields. Indifferent to The Wick (too far away to matter — for now).

### The Ducal Family
- **Leader:** Duchess Forza (charred, barely alive). Princess Viola (de facto, driven by vengeance).
- **Goals:** Survive. Kill all red priests. Find Bianca. The Duchess wants peace; Viola wants blood.
- **Disposition toward PCs:** Suspicious but potentially allied. Viola will cooperate with anyone hunting red priests. Duchess Forza is too damaged to have an agenda beyond her children's safety.
- **Relations:** Mortal enemies of the Red Priests. Pity and horror toward the Lovely Horrors (their former court). No knowledge of or interest in The Wick.

### The Lovely Horrors
- **Leader:** None. Baroness Oklavia (Cell 8) has the most social influence. Sir Tybalt and Sir Valentine (Council Chamber, Area 28) have the loudest opinions.
- **Goals:** Maintain their lifestyle. Acquire servants, luxury, entertainment. Most are too insane to have coherent long-term goals.
- **Disposition toward PCs:** Unpredictable. May try to seduce, recruit, entertain, or eat the party — sometimes all in the same conversation. Respond well to flattery and gifts. Respond poorly to being reminded of their mutations.
- **Relations:** Loyal to Duchess Forza (in their own broken way). Hostile to Red Priests (instinct). Indifferent to everything else.

### Ashfall Mine Inhabitants
- **Leader:** The Tunnel Hulk (Room 10) dominates the lower levels. The undead in the Bone Chamber (Room 7) are autonomous.
- **Goals:** Territorial. The Tunnel Hulk wants to be left alone. The undead guard their burial site. Whatever carved the deeper tunnels is unknown.
- **Disposition toward PCs:** Hostile when territory is invaded. The mine's creatures do not pursue beyond the mine entrance.
- **Relations:** No connections to other factions. The mine is its own isolated ecosystem. The Deep Stair may connect to something larger, but this is unexplored.

### The Bandit Company
- **Leader:** **Caven** (45, Human, former Sellsword, scarred, pragmatic). Operates from a camp in hex 0205 with lookouts in hex 0202.
- **Goals:** Profit. Prey on travelers, caravans, and prospectors. Avoid fights they cannot win. Caven is smart enough to negotiate when outmatched and ruthless enough to ambush when he has the advantage.
- **Disposition toward PCs:** Hostile unless given reason not to be. Will demand tolls. Can be hired for dirty work if the price is right (50 GP/head minimum). Caven respects strength and despises weakness.
- **Relations:** Enemy of The Wick (Aldric has a standing 200 GP bounty on Caven's head). No dealings with the Keep factions. Occasionally trades with the stranded merchant in hex 0602. Fear the Bogwitch.
