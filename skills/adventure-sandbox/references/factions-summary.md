## Faction Summary

### The Wick Settlement
- **Leader:** Reeve Aldric
- **Goals:** Survive, expand, secure trade routes, map the frontier
- **Disposition toward PCs:** Cautiously positive. PCs are useful but expendable. Aldric pays fairly and remembers loyalty. Betray the settlement's trust and you will not be welcome.
- **Relations:** Hostile to bandits. Wary of the Red Priests (unaware of their existence unless PCs report). Neutral toward the Ducal Family (legends, not real threats). Unaware of the Lovely Horrors.

### The Red Priests of Vermesh
- **Leader:** No formal leader; Sycorax (Dragon Suite, Area 37) is the most ambitious. Godric, Harlow, and Ravenna (Duke Avito's Room, Area 54) are the most dangerous.
- **Goals:** Complete the ritual to summon Vermesh into full reality. Spread Chaos.
- **Disposition toward PCs:** Hostile. View outsiders as either sacrifices or obstacles. Will attempt to manipulate before resorting to violence. Offer "gifts" that are always cursed or corrupted.
- **Relations:** Enemies of the Ducal Family (especially Princess Viola, who is actively hunting them). Use the Lovely Horrors as unwitting shields. Indifferent to The Wick (too far away to matter — for now).

### The Ducal Family
- **Leader:** Duchess Forza (charred, barely alive). Princess Viola (de facto, driven by vengeance).
- **Goals:** Survive. Kill all red priests. Find Bianca. The Duchess wants peace; Viola wants blood.
- **Disposition toward PCs:** Suspicious but potentially allied. Viola will cooperate with anyone hunting red priests. Duchess Forza is too damaged to have an agenda beyond her children's safety.
- **Relations:** Mortal enemies of the Red Priests. Pity and horror toward the Lovely Horrors (their former court). No knowledge of or interest in The Wick.

### The Lovely Horrors
- **Leader:** None. Baroness Oklavia (Cell 8) has the most social influence. Sir Tybalt and Sir Valentine (Council Chamber, Area 28) have the loudest opinions.
- **Goals:** Maintain their lifestyle. Acquire servants, luxury, entertainment. Most are too insane to have coherent long-term goals.
- **Disposition toward PCs:** Unpredictable. May try to seduce, recruit, entertain, or eat the party — sometimes all in the same conversation. Respond well to flattery and gifts. Respond poorly to being reminded of their mutations.
- **Relations:** Loyal to Duchess Forza (in their own broken way). Hostile to Red Priests (instinct). Indifferent to everything else.

### Ashfall Mine Inhabitants
- **Leader:** The Tunnel Hulk (Room 10) dominates the lower levels. The undead in the Bone Chamber (Room 7) are autonomous.
- **Goals:** Territorial. The Tunnel Hulk wants to be left alone. The undead guard their burial site. Whatever carved the deeper tunnels is unknown.
- **Disposition toward PCs:** Hostile when territory is invaded. The mine's creatures do not pursue beyond the mine entrance.
- **Relations:** No connections to other factions. The mine is its own isolated ecosystem. The Deep Stair may connect to something larger, but this is unexplored.

### The Bandit Company
- **Leader:** **Caven** (45, Human, former Sellsword, scarred, pragmatic). Operates from a camp in hex 0205 with lookouts in hex 0202.
- **Goals:** Profit. Prey on travelers, caravans, and prospectors. Avoid fights they cannot win. Caven is smart enough to negotiate when outmatched and ruthless enough to ambush when he has the advantage.
- **Disposition toward PCs:** Hostile unless given reason not to be. Will demand tolls. Can be hired for dirty work if the price is right (50 GP/head minimum). Caven respects strength and despises weakness.
- **Relations:** Enemy of The Wick (Aldric has a standing 200 GP bounty on Caven's head). No dealings with the Keep factions. Occasionally trades with the stranded merchant in hex 0602. Fear the Bogwitch.
