### Harbor Encounters (1d20, each time party rows to a new destination)

| Roll | Encounter |
|------|-----------|
| 1 | A human scream echoes across the water |
| 2 | Three skeletons climb a rock and leap onto the boat |
| 3 | Two kettle crabs nip at oars and hands |
| 4 | A vulgrane swoops down making clawing passes |
| 5 | Three harbor sharks ram the boat, trying to flip it |
| 6 | A giant blue tentacle rises, smashes a shipwreck, slips back down |
| 7 | Lone sailor Carlo in yellow jacket on a raft, shark circling |
| 8 | Four desperate starving sailors in yellow jackets row toward party, cutlasses drawn (Leo, Donato, Marco, Paul) |
| 9 | Green bottle with message from Bruno: love letter to Olivia, written while clinging to a rock as sharks close in |
| 10 | Five harbor sharks thrash below surface. Logs and yellow jacket bob away. Two sailors already dead. Sharks ignore party unless attacked. |
| 11 | Sickly white floating corpse. Touch it: belches foul fumes, all within 10' save vs poison or 1d6 damage |
| 12 | Large turtle with gleaming black shell and human face. Once a person, lost ability to reason or talk. |
| 13 | Two vulgranes fighting over a bloody man (sailor Ivano, saw red flash from top of Keep before red storm) fall out of sky near party |
| 14 | Raft with three kettle crabs tearing open a body in yellow jacket. Silver gleams in dead hand (angelfire grenade). |
| 15 | Upside-down rowboat traveling in a straight line. Hidden: two Keep soldiers (Cosmo and Delia) trying to escape. Reveal secret hatch in grassy hillside (Area 13 Grounds) and give a black iron key. |
| 16 | Sunlight reveals 3d6 skeletons on sea floor (15' down) excavating a chest: seven black pearls (200 GP each) and 6,000 SP |
| 17 | A dozen pale dolphins circle the boat three times, then hurry back to sea. The only warning they can give. |
| 18 | Seagulls land on boat. Then more. They stare hungrily. Sudden movement scares them off. |
| 19 | Small black cloud dumps cold rain on the boat for half an hour. Boat half-fills, risk of capsizing unless bailed. |
| 20 | Red lightning flickers in storm clouds over the Keep. Thunder sounds like lions roaring mixed with pigs squealing. |
