## Quickstart Dungeon: Ashfall Mine

**Location:** Hex 0201 (Hills, Risky)
**Danger Level:** Risky (random encounter check every 2 crawling rounds)
**Theme:** An abandoned iron mine that broke into something older underneath
**Designed For:** Level 1 characters, completable in one session
**Light:** Total darkness throughout unless noted

### Background

The Ashfall Mine operated for three decades, supplying The Wick with iron ore. Six months ago, miners broke through a natural rock wall into a network of ancient tunnels. Two miners disappeared. Then three more. The foreman sealed the lower tunnels, but something had already gotten in. The mine was abandoned within a week. The Reeve posted a bounty: 50 GP to clear the mine and determine what happened, plus 100 GP for any recovered ore or equipment.

### Environment

- **Ceilings:** 8 feet in mine tunnels, 15-20 feet in natural caverns
- **Walls:** Timber-shored mine tunnels (upper), raw limestone caverns (lower)
- **Air:** Dusty in upper mine, damp and mineral-sharp in lower caverns
- **Sounds:** Dripping water, distant echoes, occasional grinding stone
- **Temperature:** Cool in mine tunnels, warm near the deep stair (geothermal)

### Random Encounters (1d6)

Roll every 2 crawling rounds:

| d6 | Encounter |
|----|-----------|
| 1 | 1d4 giant rats (scavenging for food, flee if outnumbered) |
| 2 | 1 Cavern Stalker (hunting from ceiling, drops on last party member) |
| 3 | 2d4 bats (non-hostile swarm, extinguish unprotected flames) |
| 4 | Distant rumbling (structural settling, no danger, but unnerving) |
| 5 | 1d3 skeletons (reanimated miners, still holding tools) |
| 6 | Cold draft from below (torches flicker, -10' light radius for 1 turn) |

### Room Key

#### 1. Mine Entrance

**Connections:** South to Room 2, old cart tracks visible

A timber-framed arch marks the mine entrance, half-collapsed on the right side. Rusted iron cart tracks run into the darkness. A cold draft pushes steadily outward, carrying the smell of damp stone and something faintly metallic. Broken lanterns hang from iron hooks on the support beams. A faded sign reads: "ASHFALL MINE — NO NAKED FLAMES PAST MARKER 6."

- **Hazard:** The right support beam is cracked. Loud noise or impact (combat, explosions) has a 2-in-6 chance of collapsing the entrance (1d6 damage, save to avoid being trapped — 1 turn to dig out)
- **Treasure:** None
- **Secret:** Carved into the left beam, barely visible: tally marks. 47 marks, then a jagged slash through the last five. The foreman's count of days since the breakthrough.

#### 2. Flooded Shaft

**Connections:** North to Room 1, East to Room 3, South to Room 4

The tunnel slopes downward into knee-deep murky water that smells of rust and rot. Rat nests crowd the higher ground along the walls — matted fur, bones, and shredded cloth. Old mining tools lie scattered in the water: pickaxes, shovels, a wheelbarrow on its side. The water is cold and still.

- **Creatures:** 2d4 giant rats nest here. They attack only if their nests are disturbed or the party lingers more than 2 turns.
- **Hazard:** Moving through knee-deep water is noisy. Random encounter checks in adjacent rooms are made at +1 (easier to trigger).
- **Treasure:** A miner's leather satchel wedged behind a support beam, above waterline. Contains: 12 SP, a steel hand mirror, and a sketch of a woman labeled "Lila — come home."
- **Secret:** The wheelbarrow conceals a sealed tin box (requires STR check to pry open): 6 sticks of blasting powder (treat as grenades, 2d6 in 10' radius, extremely dangerous near structural supports).

#### 3. Foreman's Office

**Connections:** West to Room 2

A small dry room cut into the rock, elevated above the water level. Timber door (swollen shut, STR check to force). Inside: a heavy oak desk, an iron lockbox, a cot with a moth-eaten blanket, and a lantern with oil still in it.

- **Creatures:** None
- **Treasure:** The iron lockbox is locked (pick lock or force with STR check at -2). Contains: 35 GP (payroll), a silver pocket watch (15 GP), and a vial of antitoxin.
- **Secret:** The desk drawer contains the foreman's journal. Final entries:

> *Day 41 — Boys hit a crack in the east wall of shaft 4. Cold air pouring through. Smells wrong. Old.*
>
> *Day 43 — Sent Gregor and Tam to explore. They found tunnels. Old ones. Not natural, not mined. Something carved them.*
>
> *Day 45 — Gregor is missing. Tam came back but won't speak. Stares at the wall. I'm sealing the crack tomorrow.*
>
> *Day 47 — Three more gone in the night. No screams. Just gone. We're leaving. Whatever is down there, it can keep the iron.*

#### 4. The Crack

**Connections:** North to Room 2, South to Room 5 (natural fissure), East to Room 6

A jagged fissure in the mine wall, roughly four feet wide and seven feet tall. The timber shoring around it has been torn away — from the inside. Beyond the crack, the architecture changes: no more straight tunnels and timber supports. Instead, smooth-walled passages that curve organically, as if carved by water or something that moved like water. The stone here is darker, veined with a faint mineral glitter.

- **Hazard:** The edges of the crack are sharp volcanic glass. Squeezing through without caution: 1d4 slashing damage. Stating caution: no damage but costs 1 extra turn.
- **Creatures:** None, but scratching sounds echo from below
- **Treasure:** None
- **Secret:** The glittering veins in the stone are trace deposits of nechrome — star-metal from the Old World. Worthless in this quantity, but a sign that deeper tunnels may hold workable deposits (major treasure, worth reporting to the Reeve or Dag).

#### 5. Fungal Cavern

**Connections:** North to Room 4, South to Room 7, Down to Room 8

A natural cavern, 30 feet across, ceiling lost in darkness above. Clusters of bioluminescent mushrooms grow from the walls and floor, casting a sickly blue-green glow (dim light, 15' radius). The air is thick with spores. The floor is spongy with fungal growth.

- **Creatures:** 1 Cavern Stalker clings to the ceiling directly above the largest mushroom cluster. It attacks when a character moves beneath it, dropping with surprise on a 3-in-6. See bestiary skill for stat block.
- **Hazard:** The spores are mildly toxic. Spending more than 3 turns in this room without covering mouth/nose: CON check or suffer -1 to all rolls for 1d6 hours (dizzy, nauseous).
- **Treasure:** Among the mushroom clusters: a dead miner's body (Gregor, from the journal). His pack contains: 8 SP, a silver ring (5 GP), and a crude map scratched on leather showing rooms 1-4 of the mine with an arrow pointing south labeled "DON'T."
- **Secret:** Some of the mushrooms are edible and restorative. A character with herbalism knowledge (INT check) can harvest 1d4 doses of cave moss salve (heals 1d4 HP when applied to wounds). They rot in 3 days.

#### 6. Underground Stream

**Connections:** West to Room 4, East to Room 9

A fast-flowing underground stream cuts through a low-ceilinged passage. The water is clear and bitterly cold, knee-deep at the edges and waist-deep in the center. Smooth stepping stones cross the stream in a line, but several are slick with algae.

- **Creatures:** None
- **Hazard:** Crossing the stepping stones requires a DEX check. Failure: character slips into the stream. The current is strong — STR check to avoid being swept 30 feet downstream into a rocky grotto (1d6 damage from impact).
- **Treasure:** Submerged in a deep pool at the base of a rock formation: a locked iron chest (visible with a light source, requires diving to reach). Contains: 60 GP in mixed coins, a silver dagger (15 GP), and a **Glowstone** (fist-sized crystal that emits dim light in a 10' radius when squeezed, lasts 8 hours per day, recharges at dawn).
- **Secret:** The water is safe to drink and exceptionally pure. Filling waterskins here counts as a fresh water source (relevant for long expeditions).

#### 7. Bone Chamber

**Connections:** North to Room 5, East to Room 10

An ancient burial niche predating the mine by centuries. Alcoves line the walls, each containing skeletal remains wrapped in rotted cloth. The bones are arranged with care — arms crossed, skulls facing east. Faded symbols are painted above each alcove in a pigment that still faintly glows: spirals, crescents, open eyes.

- **Creatures:** Disturbing any bones causes 1d4+1 skeletons to animate. They fight with ancient bronze weapons (1d6 damage). If the party leaves the remains alone, nothing happens.
- **Hazard:** The painted symbols are Old World ward-marks. A character who can read ancient languages (INT check at -2) recognizes them as warnings: "The sleepers below must not wake."
- **Treasure:** One alcove contains a skeleton clutching a bronze amulet set with a pale blue stone. **Sleeper's Amulet** (wear to gain advantage on saves vs. sleep, charm, and fear effects while underground; the amulet grows warm when undead are within 30').
- **Secret:** Behind the deepest alcove, hidden by a stone slab (STR check to move): a narrow passage leading to Room 8.

#### 8. The Altar

**Connections:** Up from Room 5, West from Room 7 (secret), South to Room 10

A circular chamber with a domed ceiling, 20 feet in diameter. In the center stands a stone altar carved from a single block of dark basalt. Its surface is covered in spiral carvings that seem to shift in torchlight. A faint hum fills the room — felt more than heard.

Above the altar, clinging to the domed ceiling in a leathery mass: a Shroudwing nest. Two Shroudwings hang motionless, wrapped in their own wings. They drop and attack if the altar is touched or if bright light is brought within 5 feet.

- **Creatures:** 2 Shroudwings. See bestiary skill for stat block.
- **Treasure:** On the altar: a tarnished silver chalice (25 GP) and a **Voidglass Lens** (monocle-sized disc of black glass; look through it to see invisible creatures and hidden doors within 15' — but while looking through it, the user cannot see anything in normal light).
- **Secret:** Pressing both palms flat against the altar and speaking any word causes the spirals to glow briefly. The character feels a surge of warmth and recovers 1d6 HP. This works once per character, ever. After use, the spirals go dark for that character permanently.

#### 9. Collapsed Gallery

**Connections:** West to Room 6, South to Room 10

A wide gallery that once connected deeper mine shafts, now choked with rubble from a ceiling collapse. Dust hangs in the air. Wooden beams jut from the debris at odd angles. The silence here is oppressive.

- **Creatures:** The ghost of a trapped miner (Tam, from the journal) manifests as a flickering blue shape near the largest rubble pile. He does not attack. He points repeatedly at a specific spot in the rubble and mouths words: "Still here. Still here." If the rubble is cleared (2 turns of work, or faster with blasting powder — risky), his body is found beneath with his treasure. Once his body is recovered, the ghost fades.
- **Hazard:** Clearing rubble is noisy. Automatic random encounter check. Using blasting powder: clears rubble instantly but triggers a secondary collapse (everyone in the room: save or 2d6 damage).
- **Treasure:** On Tam's body: 15 GP, a steel hand axe, and a **Miner's Charm** (iron pendant shaped like a pickaxe; while worn, the bearer can sense structural instability — the GM warns the player before entering rooms with collapse hazards).
- **Secret:** Beyond the rubble, a continuation of the gallery extends south toward Room 10.

#### 10. The Deep Stair

**Connections:** North to Room 8, North to Room 9, West to Room 7

The largest chamber in the complex, 40 feet across with a vaulted ceiling 25 feet high. In the center of the floor: a spiral staircase carved directly into the bedrock, descending into absolute darkness. The stairs are wide enough for two abreast, the steps worn smooth by countless feet over centuries. Warm air rises from below, carrying a faint sulfurous smell. The walls around the stairwell are covered in Old World carvings: armies marching, cities burning, a great darkness swallowing the sun.

At the top of the staircase, blocking descent: a **Tunnel Hulk**. It has made this chamber its lair. Bones, ore chunks, and shiny debris are piled around the stairwell in a crude nest.

- **Creatures:** 1 Tunnel Hulk (boss encounter). See bestiary skill for stat block. It fights to the death to defend its nest.
- **Hazard:** The staircase descends beyond the scope of this adventure — it leads to deeper Old World ruins. The Reeve will pay 200 GP for confirmed report of the staircase's existence and its depth.
- **Treasure:** In the Tunnel Hulk's nest: 87 GP in scattered coins, 3 chunks of raw iron ore (10 GP each to Dag), a **Sunforged Blade** (short sword, +1 to hit and damage, blade glows with warm amber light equivalent to a torch — cannot be extinguished except by sheathing; originally forged to fight creatures of the dark).
- **Secret:** The carvings on the walls depict the Unraveling — the catastrophe that ended the Old World. A character who studies them for 1 turn and succeeds on an INT check learns: "The darkness came from below. They sealed the stairs. They thought it would be enough."
