## Overworld Encounter Tables

Use these tables when the party is traveling through the hex map. Roll when indicated by the danger level. These are for wilderness hexes only — dungeon-specific encounter tables are in their respective sections above.

### Road / Grassland Encounters (1d8)

| d8 | Encounter |
|----|-----------|
| 1 | Merchant caravan (1d4 wagons, 2d6 guards). Selling provisions at double price. Nervous about the road ahead. Will pay for escort to The Wick (25 GP/person). |
| 2 | Brinehound patrol (1d4+1). Territorial, aggressive. Tracking something wounded. 2-in-6 chance they have a prisoner (lost traveler, worth 50 GP bounty alive). See bestiary skill for stat block. |
| 3 | Bandits (2d4). Demand toll: 10 GP per person or "we take what we want." Led by a scarred Sellsword deserter. Will negotiate if outmatched. Camp is in hex 0205. |
| 4 | Lost traveler. Scholar/pilgrim/merchant (equal odds). Dehydrated, out of supplies. Knows one rumor about a nearby hex if helped. |
| 5 | Wildlife. Deer herd (2d6), startled. Bolt in random direction. 1-in-6 chance of stampede through party (DEX check or 1d4 damage). Good hunting — 1d4 days of rations if pursued and killed. |
| 6 | Abandoned camp. Cold fire pit, torn tent, scattered belongings. Signs of hasty departure. 1d6: 1-2=bandits took the occupants, 3-4=creature attack (tracks lead to nearest risky hex), 5-6=occupants fled a hallucination (cursed ground, save vs spells or paranoia for 1d4 hours). |
| 7 | Weather event. 1d4: 1=sudden fog (visibility 30', lasts 2d6 hours), 2=downpour (travel time +50%, ranged attacks -2), 3=lightning storm (seek cover or 1-in-20 strike for 2d6), 4=unnatural cold snap (CON check or 1d4 cold damage, water freezes). |
| 8 | Signs of passage. Fresh tracks, broken branches, territorial markings. INT check to identify: 1d4: 1=Brinehound pack heading toward The Wick, 2=large creature (Tunnel Hulk), 3=booted humanoids (bandits or soldiers), 4=drag marks (something taken). |

### Forest Encounters (1d8)

| d8 | Encounter |
|----|-----------|
| 1 | Webspinner ambush (1d3). Webs strung between trees at face height. Lead Webspinner drops from canopy. Others flank. See bestiary skill for stat block. Use webspinner_npc oracle table for details. |
| 2 | Wolf pack (2d4). Circling, testing. Will not attack a group of 4+ with torches unless desperate (winter, injured). Alpha watches from treeline. Killing alpha scatters pack. |
| 3 | Bogwitch's dwelling. Ramshackle hut in a clearing, smoke from chimney. **Old Maren** (age unknown, Bogwitch). Offers trade: potions, information, curses removed — always at a price. Never money. Wants favors, memories, or small cruelties. See bestiary skill for Bogwitch stat block. |
| 4 | Fey trickster. Small glowing figure darts between trees, giggling. Leads party in circles (WIS check to resist). If followed for 1 hour: leads to a hidden treasure (50 GP in old coins buried under a stone) then vanishes. If ignored: plays harmless pranks (unties bootlaces, hides rations). |
| 5 | Ancient tree shrine. Massive oak with carved face, offerings of coins and dried flowers at its roots. Leaving an offering (any value): +1 to a single roll before next rest. Taking offerings: cursed — lose 1d6 GP worth of possessions each day (items fall from packs, slip from fingers) until offering is returned twofold. |
| 6 | Bear (1). Foraging. Not hostile unless cubs are nearby (2-in-6). Cubs present: mother attacks on sight. No cubs: bear flees if party makes noise. Bear den nearby has 1d20 GP in coins from previous victims. |
| 7 | Lost hunter. **Jory** (25, Human, Warden aspirant). Separated from hunting party three days ago. Knows the forest well. Will guide party through one forest hex for free if helped. Knows location of the Webspinner colony (hex 0305). |
| 8 | Rockfang nest (1d3). Burrowed into hillside under tree roots. Territorial. Attack anything that approaches within 20'. Nest contains: gnawed bones, 2d10 GP in scattered coins, and a corroded but functional short sword. See bestiary skill for stat block. |

### Hills / Mountains Encounters (1d8)

| d8 | Encounter |
|----|-----------|
| 1 | Tunnel Hulk (1). Erupts from ground. Aggressive, territorial. Lair entrance visible nearby — a 10' wide tunnel into the hillside. Lair contains: 3d20 GP, bones, and a random piece of Old World equipment (roll on treasure table or improvise). See bestiary skill for stat block. |
| 2 | Bloodwing flock (2d4). Circling overhead, diving. Attack exposed flesh. Retreat if 3+ are killed. Nest on high cliff face — eggs are worth 25 GP each to collectors (3d4 eggs if nest found). See bestiary skill for stat block. |
| 3 | Goat herders (1d4 herders, 2d10 goats). From a seasonal camp. Friendly but wary. Trade goat cheese and milk for news or small goods. Know about nearby caves ("don't go in the one that smells of sulfur"). |
| 4 | Collapsed mine entrance. Old timber framing, rusted tools. 2-in-6 the collapse is recent and someone is trapped inside (muffled cries). Clearing rubble: 2 turns, STR check, risk of secondary collapse (1-in-6, 1d6 damage). Trapped person: 1d4: 1=prospector with map fragment, 2=bandit scout, 3=wounded Ironborn miner, 4=already dead. |
| 5 | Rockslide. DEX check or 2d6 damage. Triggered by: 1d4: 1=natural erosion, 2=Tunnel Hulk burrowing nearby, 3=Bloodwings nesting disturbance, 4=old trap (deliberate). Path blocked — find alternate route (adds 2 hours) or climb over (DEX check, 1d6 fall damage on failure). |
| 6 | Eagle nest on high crag. Giant eagle (non-hostile, observes from above). Nest contains: 1d4 shiny objects stolen from travelers (gems, coins, a silver mirror, a brass compass). Climbing to nest: 60' climb, DEX check, eagle attacks if eggs are present (1-in-4). |
| 7 | Bandit lookout (1d3 bandits). Watching the road/trail from a rocky outcrop. Will signal main camp (hex 0205) if party spotted. Can be surprised (2-in-6) if party is stealthy. Lookout has: spyglass (25 GP), signal horn, 2d6 GP, crude map of bandit patrol routes. |
| 8 | Ironborn prospectors (1d4). Mining a small claim. Territorial about their site but willing to trade. Sell raw ore (5 GP/unit), buy torches and rations at 150% markup. Know about veins of nechrome in deeper caves ("star-metal — worth a fortune, but the things down there..."). |

### Swamp Encounters (1d8)

| d8 | Encounter |
|----|-----------|
| 1 | Cavern Stalker (1). Disguised as a log in shallow water. Attacks when a character steps within 5'. See bestiary skill for stat block. |
| 2 | Giant leeches (1d6). Attach during wading. Unnoticed for 1d4 rounds (CON check to notice sooner). Each leech: 1 damage/round, must be burned or salted off (pulling tears flesh for extra 1d4). |
| 3 | Will-o'-wisps (1d3). Glowing lights bobbing over the water. WIS check to resist following. Leading toward: 1d4: 1=quicksand (STR check or sink, 1d6 rounds to drown), 2=deep water (sudden drop, drowning risk), 3=Bogwitch's territory, 4=actually a trapped spirit that wants to show party a hidden treasure cache (75 GP in a waterproof chest). |

| 5 | Poisonous gas pocket. Bubbles rise from mud. CON check or 1d6 poison damage and nauseated for 1d4 hours (-2 to all rolls). Visible with careful observation (INT check to notice before entering area). Fire near the gas: explosion, 2d6 to all within 15'. |
| 6 | Crocodile (1). Lurking in shallows. Attacks with surprise (3-in-6). Death roll: on hit, grapples and drags underwater. STR check to escape. 1d8 damage per round while grappled. |
| 7 | Stranded merchant. Cart stuck in mud, mule dead. **Petra** (35, Gremlin, fast-talking). Claims bandits chased her off the road. Actually smuggling contraband: 3 vials of Red Orchid Dust (hallucinogenic, 50 GP each on the black market) and stolen silverware (200 GP). Will pay 25 GP for escort back to civilization. |
| 8 | Bogwitch (1). Gathering ingredients at water's edge. Hostile if surprised, wary otherwise. Knows the swamp intimately. Can be bargained with — she wants rare mushrooms from the Ashfall Mine (Fungal Cavern, Room 5). Will trade a potion of her choice for 4 doses of cave moss. See bestiary skill for stat block. |

### Ruins Encounters (1d8)

Use the `random_encounter_ruins` oracle table from the MCP server for ruins encounters. If the oracle table is unavailable, use this fallback:

| d8 | Encounter |
|----|-----------|
| 1 | Scavengers (1d4+1). Armed, suspicious. Searching for Old World artifacts. Will trade information for supplies. Know about one unexplored room/area in the nearest dungeon. |
| 2 | Undead patrol (2d4 skeletons). Marching in formation, following an ancient route. Ignore the party unless attacked or blocked. Destroying all of them reveals: 1d20 GP in corroded coins and a fragment of an Old World map. |
| 3 | Structural collapse. Floor/wall/ceiling gives way. DEX check or 2d6 damage. Reveals: 1d4: 1=hidden room (small, empty), 2=buried chest (locked, 30 GP), 3=tunnel to lower level, 4=nothing but rubble. |
| 4 | Shroudwing (1). Nesting in rafters/ceiling. Drops onto light sources to extinguish them. See bestiary skill for stat block. |
| 5 | Old World mechanism. Gears, levers, pipes. Still partially functional. INT check to operate: 1d4: 1=opens a sealed door nearby, 2=activates a light source (lasts 1d6 hours), 3=triggers a trap (poison darts, 1d6), 4=does nothing visible (actually signals something deeper). |
| 6 | Cursed ground. Unease, whispers at edge of hearing. WIS check or -1 to all rolls while in the area. Spending a full turn praying or performing a cleansing ritual removes the effect. Source: unburied dead in a shallow pit nearby. Burying them properly ends the curse permanently. |
| 7 | Territorial creature. 1d4: 1=Rockfang, 2=Bloodwing pair, 3=giant spider, 4=Cavern Stalker. Has claimed this ruin as its lair. Fights to defend territory but will not pursue more than 100' from lair. |
| 8 | Intact chamber. Miraculously undamaged room. Contains: furniture, books (mostly ruined), and one intact item of value: 1d4: 1=silver candelabra (50 GP), 2=Old World painting (100 GP to a collector), 3=sealed bottle of ancient spirits (25 GP, or drink for +2 to CHA checks for 1 hour), 4=journal describing the Unraveling in personal terms (valuable to scholars, 200 GP). |
