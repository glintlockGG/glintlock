### Ending the Adventure

**If Vermesh is not defeated**: Chaos spreads. Lovely horrors and humans mutate further into demonic creatures. Island declared a hazard.

**If Vermesh is defeated**: Chaos fades. Monsters retreat. Lovely horrors weaken. Survivors beg passage to mainland. Obsidian Keep stands empty until another cult or pirates move in.

**If either princess survives**: They take up a lifelong pilgrimage bolstering Law and opposing Chaos. Their exploits become legendary.

**In any case**: The Archbishop uses the tragedy to keep the people faithful and subservient.
