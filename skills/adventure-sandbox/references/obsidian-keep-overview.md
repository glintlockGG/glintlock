## The Obsidian Keep

An adventure for level 2-4, playable in several sessions. Emphasizes exploration, mystery-solving, and social encounters, with opportunities for combat (always risky).

**Location:** The Obsidian Keep sits on Isla Cineria, a volcanic island in the Sunless Sea. Access via hex 0503 (The Sunless Shore), then by boat to hex 0603. The island is roughly three miles long. The Keep dominates the eastern promontory, visible from the beach as a black spire against the perpetual storm clouds.

### Background

On the subterranean shores of the Sunless Sea stands the holy city of Radiant Vitelis. In the center of the sea lies Isla Cineria, where the lords of the Obsidian Keep harass passing ships with their magics. Duchess Forza mastered sorcery. Her husband Duke Avito grew jealous of her power.

One year ago, the Archbishop of Radiant Vitelis secretly sent the red priests of Vermesh to seduce and corrupt Duke Avito. Two weeks ago, the Archbishop sent a fleet of holy warships to destroy the Obsidian Keep. The fleet never returned.

During the attack, Duke Avito sacrificed his youngest daughter Bianca to summon the immortal horror Vermesh. The half-completed ritual caused a "red storm" of Chaos energy, destroying the fleet and devastating the Obsidian Keep. The Duke fumbled the knife and Vermesh bit off his arm (fatal). Bianca was left in limbo with a crystal knife in her heart.

**Today:** Shattered fleet in the harbor. Survivors huddle on the beach. Inside the Keep, a nightmare of mutations, chaos, and undeath. Duchess Forza lies mostly dead. Duke Avito is entirely dead. Vermesh lurks ethereally, waiting to complete the ritual.

### Adventure Hooks

1. **Archbishop's Call** (Lawful): Sail to Isla Cineria and learn the fate of the fleet. Rewards for saving sailors (50 GP each), recovering relics (500 GP each), and proof that Duke Avito and Duchess Forza are dead (5,000 GP each).
2. **Treasure Hunter** (Chaotic): Master Argento wants treasure hunters to recover valuables. Rewards for eye witnesses (25 GP each), weapons (250 GP each), Obsidian Keep rarities (1,000 GP each), items belonging to the Duke/Duchess (5,000 GP each).
