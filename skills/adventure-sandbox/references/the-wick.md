## Home Base: The Wick

**Population:** ~200 (humans, Ironborn, a handful of Faekin and Duskfolk)
**Danger Level:** Safe (within the beacon's light radius)

A frontier settlement built around a decommissioned beacon tower at the very edge of explored territory. The tower's ancient crystal still glows faintly — enough to keep the worst creatures at bay within a quarter-mile radius. Beyond that circle, The Wick is just another cluster of buildings in the dark.

The settlement is a rough collection of timber-and-stone buildings arranged in concentric rings around the tower. The inner ring holds essential services. The outer ring holds residences, animal pens, and storage. A wooden palisade with iron-banded gates marks the boundary. Guards walk the wall with torches at all hours.

### The Tallow (Tavern & Inn)

Run by **Marta** (50, Human, stern, practical, missing three fingers on her left hand — lost to frostbite, not combat, though she lets people assume otherwise). The Tallow is the social heart of The Wick: part tavern, part hiring hall, part post office. Marta keeps order with a heavy hand and a heavier iron ladle.

- **Common room bed:** 5 SP/night (straw pallet, shared room with 8 others)
- **Private room:** 2 GP/night (lockable door, actual mattress, candle stub)
- **Hot meal:** 3 SP (stew of whatever Marta has, bread, weak ale)
- **Strong drink:** 5 SP (homebrewed spirits, burns going down)
- **Rumors:** Buy a round for the house (2 GP) for 1d3 rumors from the rumor table
- **Message board:** Notes pinned behind the bar from travelers, merchants, and the desperate

### Greer's Provisions (General Store)

Run by **Greer** (40, Human, cheerful, round-faced, overcharges strangers by 20% until they have done at least one favor for the settlement). Greer controls the only reliable supply of torches, rope, rations, and basic gear in the region. He knows it. Prices reflect scarcity, not greed — mostly.

- **Torch (6-pack):** 1 GP (standard price is 5 SP; scarcity markup)
- **Lantern oil (1 flask):** 2 GP
- **Iron rations (1 week):** 5 GP
- **Hemp rope (50'):** 3 GP
- **Iron spikes (12):** 2 GP
- **Chalk (10 sticks):** 5 SP
- **Healing poultice:** 10 GP (restores 1d4 HP, Greer makes them himself, limited stock of 1d4 available per week)
- **No magic items, no enchanted gear, no scrolls.** If it glows, it came from the ruins, not a shop shelf.
- **Gear repair:** 50% of item's base price

### The Forge

Run by **Dag** (55, Ironborn, quiet, builds to last). Dag is the only competent smith within three days' travel. He does not rush. He does not haggle. He does not make small talk. His work is excellent.

- **Weapon repair:** 25% of weapon's base price, ready next day
- **Armor repair:** 50% of armor's base price, ready in 1d3 days
- **Custom work:** Dag will forge specialty items if given rare materials (e.g., nechrome steel, volcanic glass). Prices negotiated per job.
- **Ammunition:** arrows (1 GP/12), bolts (1 GP/12), sling bullets (5 SP/20)

### The Shrine

Tended by **Warden Eska** (30, Duskfolk, idealistic, nervous). A multi-faith shrine built from salvaged stone, honoring no single god but offering space for all. Eska is a trained Warden who came to the frontier to do good and is quietly terrified of everything beyond the palisade.

- **Blessing:** 5 GP donation for a minor blessing (+1 to a single save within the next 24 hours)
- **Healing:** Eska can treat injuries (1d6+1 HP restored, once per character per day, 10 GP donation)
- **Funeral rites:** 2 GP (Eska takes this duty very seriously)
- **Cure disease/poison:** Eska lacks the skill; characters must find other means

### The Bounty Board

Posted outside The Tallow, updated weekly by the Reeve. Bounties range from 10 GP (confirm what is in a nearby hex) to 500 GP (eliminate a confirmed major threat). The board is the primary quest-giver for sandbox play.

**Standing Bounties:**
- Map an unexplored hex: 10 GP (requires physical description, terrain, landmarks)
- Clear a hex of its primary threat: 50-200 GP (proof required — head, trophy, witness)
- Recover an Old World artifact: 100-1,000 GP (appraised by Greer or the Reeve)
- Escort a merchant caravan to the next settlement: 25 GP/person
- Locate a missing person: 50 GP (dead or alive; bonus for alive)

### The Reeve

**Aldric** (60, Human, former soldier, pragmatic). Aldric runs The Wick with a soldier's efficiency and a survivor's ruthlessness. He was part of the original expedition that founded the settlement fifteen years ago. He has seen every kind of frontier horror and no longer flinches. He pays fairly, judges quickly, and does not suffer fools.

- Aldric sets bounties, arbitrates disputes, and controls the settlement's modest treasury
- He has a map of the region with known hexes filled in (party can view but not copy without permission)
- He knows more than he lets on about the Old World ruins but will not share freely — earn his trust first
- **Aldric's Rule:** No one leaves The Wick after dark without the Reeve's permission. Violators are not rescued.
