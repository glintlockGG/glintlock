# Shadowdark RPG — Core Rules Reference

## Checks

Roll d20 + stat modifier ≥ DC = success.

| Difficulty | DC | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Easy | 9 | Leaping a narrow chasm, sneaking up on an inattentive guard |
| Normal | 12 | Kicking open a stuck door, picking a poor lock |
| Hard | 15 | Swimming against a strong current, stabilizing a dying character |
| Extreme | 18 | Climbing a slippery cliff one-handed, restraining a frenzied lion |

**When to roll:** Only when there is a negative consequence for failure, the task requires skill, AND there is time pressure. Characters automatically succeed at what they are trained to do.

**Contested checks:** Both participants roll relevant stat check simultaneously. Highest result wins. Reroll ties.

## Stats

- **Strength** — Physical power: smash doors, bend bars, lift rocks, swim
- **Dexterity** — Agility: dodge traps, disable tripwires, climb walls, sleight of hand
- **Constitution** — Endurance: hold breath, resist poison, withstand pain
- **Intelligence** — Logic: first aid (DC 15 to stabilize dying), recall paths, find food/water
- **Wisdom** — Instinct: spot hidden enemies, detect sounds, decipher noises behind doors
- **Charisma** — Presence: ventriloquism, disguises, rally terrified allies

| Stat | Modifier |
|---|---|
| 1-3 | -4 |
| 4-5 | -3 |
| 6-7 | -2 |
| 8-9 | -1 |
| 10-11 | 0 |
| 12-13 | +1 |
| 14-15 | +2 |
| 16-17 | +3 |
| 18+ | +4 |

## Advantage / Disadvantage

- **Advantage:** Roll the die twice, take the higher result
- **Disadvantage:** Roll the die twice, take the lower result
- If both apply, they cancel out

## Natural 20 / Natural 1

- **Natural 20:** Maximum success. Attack auto-hits + critical hit (double weapon damage dice). Spellcasting: double one numerical effect.
- **Natural 1:** Maximum failure. Attack auto-miss. Spellcasting critical failure: lose spell until rest. Wizard: roll mishap table. Priest: deity revokes spell, requires penance.

## Combat

**Initiative:** Everyone rolls d20 + DEX modifier. GM uses highest DEX modifier among monsters. Highest goes first, turns proceed clockwise.

**Player Turn:**
1. Count down timers for spells/effects
2. Take one action + move up to near (split movement any way). Skip action to move near again.
3. GM describes results

**Actions:**
- **Melee Attack:** d20 + STR mod + bonuses ≥ target AC
- **Ranged Attack:** d20 + DEX mod + bonuses ≥ target AC
- **Cast a Spell:** See spellcasting rules
- **Improvise:** Swing on a vine, push a boulder, etc. GM determines check.
- **Multitask:** Small parallel tasks (stand up, speak, drink potion, activate item) don't use your action.

**Damage:** Roll weapon/spell damage dice + bonuses. Critical hit: double weapon damage dice.

**Terrain:** Half cover = disadvantage on attacks against that creature. Full cover = can't target. Difficult terrain = half movement speed.

**Knockout:** You can choose to knock a creature unconscious instead of killing it at 0 HP.

## Morale

Enemies reduced to half their number (or half HP for solo enemy) **flee** if they fail a DC 15 Wisdom check. Large groups: one check with leader's WIS modifier.

## Death & Dying

- 0 HP = unconscious, dying
- **Death timer:** Roll 1d4 + CON modifier rounds (minimum 1)
- Each turn, roll d20. **Natural 20** = rise with 1 HP
- **Stabilize:** Close range, DC 15 INT check. Stops dying, still unconscious.
- Dead characters are retired from play

## Distance

- **Near:** up to ~30 feet
- **Far:** within sight

## Movement

- **Climbing:** STR or DEX check, half speed. Fall if fail by 5+ points
- **Falling:** 1d6 damage per 10 feet
- **Moving through allies:** free. Through enemies: STR or DEX check.
- **Swimming:** Half speed. STR check in rough water. Hold breath for CON modifier rounds (min 1). Then CON check each round or 1d6 damage.

## Light Sources

- **Torch:** Near distance, 1 hour real time. 3 torches = campfire (8 hours, near distance, can't be moved)
- **Lantern:** Double near distance, 1 hour real time (requires oil flask)
- **Light spell:** Near distance, 1 hour real time
- New light sources "ride along" on the current timer
- **Total darkness:** Disadvantage on most tasks. Random encounter check every crawling round.

## Resting

Sleep 8 hours + consume 1 ration = regain all HP, recover stat damage, regain lost spells.

**Interruption:** Each stressful interruption requires DC 12 CON check. Fail = consume ration but gain no benefit.

**Resting in dungeons:** Random encounter checks at overland cadence:
- Unsafe: every 3 hours
- Risky: every 2 hours
- Deadly: every hour

## Gear Slots

Carry items equal to STR stat or 10, whichever is higher. All gear = 1 slot unless noted. Coins: 100 per slot (first 100 free). Arrows/bolts: 20 per slot. Backpack: first one free.

## Stealth & Surprise

- **Hiding/sneaking:** DEX checks. Can't hide while visible.
- **Detecting:** Active search. Looking in right place = auto-detect. Otherwise WIS check.
- **Surprise:** Undetected creature gets one free turn before initiative is rolled. Advantage on attack rolls against surprised targets.

## Luck Tokens

GM awards for exceptional roleplaying, heroism, daring maneuvers. Max 1 per player. Spend to reroll any roll (must use new result). Can give to a companion.

## XP & Leveling

XP from treasure quality: Poor (0), Normal (1), Fabulous (3), Legendary (10).
Level up at: current level × 10 XP. XP resets to 0 on level up.
