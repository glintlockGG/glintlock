# Factions of the Pale Reach

Five factions operate in and around Thornwall. Their goals sometimes align, sometimes conflict. The player can build relationships, earn favor, and shape the balance of power.

## Thornwall Garrison

**Leader:** Commander Alara Vess
**Base:** Warden's Hall, Thornwall
**Strength:** 12 soldiers, 3 scouts, diminishing supplies
**Disposition:** Neutral → Friendly (earn through service)

**Goals:**
- Secure the caravan route (Caravan Route clock)
- Maintain the perimeter against increasing threats
- Keep morale from collapsing (Garrison Morale clock)

**Resources:** Military authority, bounty board, regional intelligence, patrol routes
**Conflict with:** Thornwood Goblins (raiding), The Prospectors' Compact (jurisdictional)

## The Thornwood Goblins

**Leader:** Boss Skrag (goblin warchief)
**Base:** Encampment deep in Thornwood (hex 0204)
**Strength:** 30-40 goblins, 2 goblin bosses, various beasts
**Disposition:** Hostile (default) → Suspicious/Neutral (if approached diplomatically)

**Goals:**
- Survive — the Green Maw threatens them too
- Raid supply lines for food and weapons
- Find a new home (the Thornwood is becoming dangerous)

**Resources:** Numbers, knowledge of the Thornwood, expendable scouts
**Secret:** They're not evil — they're desperate. The Green Maw is driving them out. Boss Skrag might negotiate if offered an alternative. The garrison doesn't know this.

## The Prospectors' Compact

**Leader:** Halvard Greystone (dwerrow prospector)
**Base:** Mobile — camps in Ashfall Crags (hex 0102)
**Strength:** 8 prospectors, well-equipped, experienced miners
**Disposition:** Neutral → Friendly (share intelligence, don't steal claims)

**Goals:**
- Reopen the Ashfall mines — specifically the Iron Seam
- Find and extract the living metal (they don't understand what it is)
- Establish a permanent mining camp

**Resources:** Mining expertise, coin, dwerrow-forged equipment, knowledge of the crags
**Conflict with:** The Iron Seam doom (they're inadvertently feeding it by mining)

## The Fenway Pilgrims

**Leader:** Mother Dace (human elder)
**Base:** Scattered camps in the Fenway marshes (hex 0405, 0604)
**Strength:** 15-20 pilgrims, no military capability
**Disposition:** Friendly (they welcome all travelers)

**Goals:**
- Reach the shrine at the heart of the Fenway (the Pale Shepherd's domain)
- Complete a funeral rite for their dead
- They believe the Pale Shepherd is benevolent — a guide for lost souls

**Resources:** Knowledge of safe marsh paths, herbal medicine, spiritual counsel
**Secret:** They may be right about the Shepherd — or they may be walking into a trap. Their devotion feeds the doom either way.

## The Antler Court (Fey)

**Leader:** The Thorn Queen (unseen, communicates through heralds)
**Base:** Ruins deep in Greenmere Valley (hex 0603)
**Strength:** Unknown — fey don't play by mortal rules
**Disposition:** Inscrutable — neither hostile nor friendly, always transactional

**Goals:**
- Restore a broken pact from the old world
- Reclaim Greenmere Valley as fey sovereign territory
- Acquire mortal champions for an unspecified purpose

**Resources:** Fey magic, time manipulation, illusions, enchantment, ancient knowledge
**Conflict with:** Anyone who breaks bargains. The concept of mortal ownership of the valley.
**Warning:** The Court always honors its bargains — to the letter, never the spirit. Dealing with them is never free.
