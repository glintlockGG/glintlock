# The Iron Seam

**Location:** Hex 0201 (Ashfall Crags) | **Danger:** Risky | **Doom:** Iron Seam (Portent 0-6)
**Theme:** Industry vs. nature, sleeping power, the cost of extraction, living earth

The Iron Seam is an abandoned mine driven deep into the Ashfall Crags. Prospectors broke through into something ancient — a vein of metal that grows, repairs itself, and resists extraction. The deeper shafts are warm, humming with subsonic vibration. Something vast and metallic sleeps at the bottom, and the living ore is its dreaming body.

---

## Room 1 — The Pithead

*Rotten timber frames a mine entrance scarred by claw marks and scorch damage. A rusted ore cart sits on buckled rails, half-filled with slag. Warning signs in three languages have been nailed to every surface. The newest reads: "SEALED BY ORDER OF COMMANDER VESS — DO NOT ENTER." The seal is broken.*

**Contents:** Abandoned mining equipment. A winch mechanism (functional with a Wits (Tinker) check, Difficulty 9) operates a cargo lift to Room 3. The rail tracks lead down a gentle slope to Room 2. Picks, shovels, and helmets scattered as if dropped in haste.
**Treasure:** A prospector's lockbox hidden under the ore cart. Reflex (Sleight) or Wits (Awareness) check, Difficulty 12 to find. Contains 18 gp and a **magnifying lens** that reveals hairline cracks in stone (advantage on checks to find structural weaknesses or hidden seams).

## Room 2 — The Upper Galleries

*The mine opens into a network of galleries carved from dark stone. Tool marks line every surface. Ore veins glint in the walls — but some of the metal has grown over the tool marks, filling the gouges like scar tissue. The air hums. Your fillings ache.*

**Contents:** Branching mine tunnels. Evidence of extensive extraction — and of the mine fighting back. Metal has regrown across doorways and sealed two side passages.
**Encounter:** 4 Ore Crawlers skitter along the walls, drawn to metal equipment. They prioritize targets wearing metal armor (Magnetic Pull from Iron Husks does not apply to Ore Crawlers, but their Metal Eater ability triggers). They flee into cracks if 2 are destroyed.
**Hazard:** Unstable ceiling in the eastern gallery. Loud noise or combat triggers a collapse check — Wits (Awareness) check, Difficulty 12 to notice the sagging timbers. If it collapses: Reflex check, Difficulty 12 or take d8 damage and be trapped (Vigor check, Difficulty 15 to dig free, or allies can help).

## Room 3 — The Sealed Gallery

*The cargo lift descends into a chamber where the walls gleam. Living metal has overgrown everything — timbers, tools, a miner's skeleton frozen mid-crawl, all encased in a smooth iron shell. The metal pulses with a slow rhythm, like a heartbeat. It is warm to the touch.*

**Contents:** This is where the miners first broke through to the living metal. The encased skeleton still holds a journal. Vigor (Athletics) check, Difficulty 12 to pry it free. The journal describes the initial discovery, the metal's growth rate, and the miners' increasing unease before they fled. It mentions "the voice in the deep" and "the guardian that woke."
**Hazard:** The living metal grows slowly but constantly. Spending more than 3 exploration turns in this room without moving causes metal tendrils to begin encasing boots and equipment. Reflex check, Difficulty 9 each turn after the third, or lose one piece of equipment to the metal.

## Room 4 — The Forge Chamber

*A natural cavern repurposed as a forge. The original anvil and bellows are buried under living metal growths, but the forge itself still radiates heat — fed by a volcanic vent beneath the floor. Tools made of living iron hang from the walls, gleaming and perfect despite their age. They are not rusted. They were never finished by human hands.*

**Contents:** The forge is operational. A character with Wits (Tinker) training can use it to work living metal — but the metal resists. Tinker check, Difficulty 15 to shape a piece. Success produces a weapon or tool of exceptional quality (+1 damage or +1 to a relevant skill check). The forge can be used once per visit.
**Treasure:** Three items hang on the wall: an iron chisel that never dulls (advantage on Tinker checks involving stone or metal, worth 15 gp), a set of tongs that grip living metal without it resisting (required to harvest ore in Room 6), and a **Helm of Iron Will** (helmet, Armor +1 to head only — on a critical hit against the wearer, negate the critical and treat as a normal hit instead. Fabulous quality).

## Room 5 — The Guardian's Walk

*A vertical shaft descends into orange-lit darkness. Iron rungs have been driven into the wall — some original, some grown from the living metal, indistinguishable from the rest. The humming is loud here, vibrating in your bones. Halfway down, a ledge. On the ledge, something enormous stands motionless, blocking the way.*

**Encounter:** 1 Seam Guardian. It activates when any creature passes the midpoint of the descent. The narrow shaft means only one character can engage it in melee at a time. Its Ground Slam is devastating in this confined space — the shockwave rattles climbers on the rungs (Reflex check, Difficulty 12 or fall d6 damage). Its Magnetic Shield pulls metal weapons away mid-swing.
**Tactics:** The Guardian can be bypassed without fighting. A character with no metal on their person can attempt to sneak past while it focuses on a distraction. Reflex (Stealth) check, Difficulty 15. Alternatively, a lightning-based spell or effect stuns it for 1 round — enough to rush past.

## Room 6 — The Deep Seam

*The bottom of the mine opens into a cathedral-sized cavern. The walls, floor, and ceiling are living metal — rippling, shifting, breathing. At the center, a formation rises from the floor like a throne or a cocoon. Something is inside it — vast, coiled, dreaming. The humming is a voice now, felt rather than heard. It is aware of you.*

**Contents:** The Iron Seam's source — an ancient metal entity folded into the earth. It is not hostile by nature. It is territorial and confused. It has been sleeping since before human settlement, and the mining woke it to a half-state between sleep and consciousness. The Ore Crawlers and Iron Husks are its immune system, not its army.

### Resolution Paths

**Seal It:** Collapse the vertical shaft (Room 5) using explosives, the forge, or brute force. Vigor (Athletics) check, Difficulty 15, or Tinker check, Difficulty 12 with proper tools. The entity goes back to sleep. Portent resets to 0. The living metal stops growing — but the mine is permanently inaccessible, and any living metal already harvested goes inert.

**Awaken and Bargain:** Touching the cocoon-formation triggers communication — not words, but impressions of territory, pain, intrusion. A character can attempt to negotiate through empathy and will. Resolve (Commune or Fortitude) check, Difficulty 15. Success: the entity understands. It offers a pact — it will withdraw its influence from the surface (portent resets to 0) if the party ensures no one mines its body again. It gifts a lump of living metal that can be forged into any single weapon or armor piece of Fabulous quality (+1 bonus, self-repairing).

**Harvest the Ore:** Using the tongs from Room 4, a character can extract living metal directly from the walls. Each extraction attempt takes 1 exploration turn and yields one unit (enough for one item). But each extraction enrages the entity — it spawns 2 Ore Crawlers per unit taken and eventually wakes the Seam Guardian again if more than 3 units are taken. Harvesting does NOT reduce the portent — it increases it by 1 per unit taken.

### If Left Alone

Living metal spreads through the Crags. Ore Crawlers appear in adjacent hexes, consuming metal equipment. At portent 3+, Iron Husks patrol the mine approaches. At portent 5, metal objects in Thornwall begin to corrode or behave strangely. At portent 6, the entity half-wakes — a wave of magnetic force disrupts all metal within two hexes, and the Seam Guardian roams the surface.
