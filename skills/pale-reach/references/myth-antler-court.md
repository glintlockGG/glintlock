# The Antler Court

**Location:** Hex 0603 (Greenmere Valley) | **Danger:** Risky | **Myth:** Antler Court (Omen 0-6)
**Theme:** Fey bargains, broken pacts, beauty that devours, the price of promises

The Antler Court is the ruin of a fey palace in the heart of Greenmere Valley — a place of shattered marble, wild roses, and moonlight that falls wrong. The Court was once bound by a pact with a mortal settlement that no longer exists. The pact is broken, and the fey are furious. They want satisfaction — and they are patient enough to take it slowly, one stolen mortal at a time.

---

## Room 1 — The Briar Gate

*The valley narrows between two hills crowned with standing stones. Between them, a wall of rose briars twenty feet high, blooming white and red despite the season. The flowers turn to face you. A gap in the briars forms — not an opening, an invitation. The thorns pull back like parting lips. Beyond, silver light and the sound of distant music.*

**Contents:** The briar wall is the Court's outer boundary. Passing through willingly means accepting fey hospitality — the Court will not harm guests who entered freely (but "harm" has a narrow fey definition). Forcing entry through the briars deals d6 damage per round and the briars regrow instantly.
**Hazard:** Iron objects cause the briars to recoil, creating a 5-foot gap that lasts 1 round. Carrying visible iron earns the Court's displeasure — all Presence checks inside the Court are made at disadvantage.

## Room 2 — The Silver Garden

*A garden of impossible beauty. Flowers of crystal and living light grow from silver soil. Paths of white stone wind between hedges shaped like dancing figures. The air smells of honey and ozone. Everything is perfect — too perfect. The shadows fall in the wrong direction.*

**Contents:** The garden is disorienting. Without focus, time moves strangely. Wits (Awareness) check, Difficulty 12 each exploration turn or lose track of 1 hour (counts as an exploration turn for torch and ration countdown dice, but no distance is covered). The paths loop unless navigated with intent.
**Encounter:** 3 Thorn Sprites observe from the hedges. They do not attack guests who entered willingly. If the party forced entry or carries iron openly, the sprites harass with thorn darts and Flicker away, leading the party in circles.
**Treasure:** A crystal flower can be plucked (worth 20 gp to the right buyer). Taking one without asking permission triggers a fey debt — the Court Herald will demand a favor later.

## Room 3 — The Feast Hall

*A long table set with golden plates and silver goblets stretches across a roofless hall. Columns of living wood hold up nothing — the ceiling is open sky, though the stars are wrong. Food covers the table: roast meats, honeyed fruits, wine the color of sunset. It smells magnificent. At the far end, an empty throne of woven antlers.*

**Contents:** The feast is real and edible — but fey food binds. Any character who eats must make a Resolve (Fortitude) check, Difficulty 15. Failure: the character cannot willingly leave the Court until the food's magic is broken (a day of fasting, or a specific counterspell). Success: the food nourishes as a full ration with no ill effect, and the character gains advantage on Presence checks with fey for 24 hours.
**Puzzle:** The empty throne has an inscription in Eldren script: "A seat for the Champion who honors the Pact." Sitting in it without understanding the pact triggers 2 Antler Knights to appear and demand the sitter prove their worth (combat or a contest of skill — the party chooses the contest).

## Room 4 — The Mirror Pool

*A circular pool of still water in a clearing of white birch trees. The water reflects a different sky — one with two moons. Shapes move in the reflection that have no source above. A stone tablet stands at the pool's edge, half-overgrown with moss.*

**Contents:** The tablet records the original pact in Eldren and Common. Lore (History) check, Difficulty 12 to read the full text. The pact: a mortal village called Greenmere promised the Court "a champion every generation" to serve the fey for a year and a day. In exchange, the Court protected the valley from all threats. Greenmere was destroyed decades ago. No champion has come. The fey consider the debt unpaid.
**Puzzle:** The mirror pool shows truth. A character who gazes into it sees themselves as the fey see them — their deepest flaw and their greatest virtue. This is narrative (GM describes what the character sees based on their personality and history). Mechanically, gazing grants advantage on the next Presence check made within the Court.

## Room 5 — The Thorn Bower

*A chamber woven from living briars — walls, floor, ceiling, all thorns. At its center, a figure kneels in chains of flowering vine. It is humanoid, dressed in the remnants of fine clothes. It looks up with hollow eyes and says, "Are you the one they sent? Please. I have been here so long."*

**Contents:** A prisoner — the last person who wandered into the Court, taken as a substitute champion. They have been here for months (or years — time is uncertain). They are alive but diminished. Freeing them is straightforward (the vine-chains break easily) but doing so without the Court's permission means the party owes a debt.
**Encounter:** If the prisoner is freed without permission, 2 Antler Knights arrive in 2 rounds to reclaim them or demand a replacement. Combat is possible but the knights are formidable (HP 8, Armor 2, and Wild Hunt Charge in the confined bower is devastating).
**Treasure:** The prisoner carries a **Locket of Greenmere** — a keepsake from the destroyed village. Worth nothing in gold, but presenting it to the Court Herald proves knowledge of the pact and opens the diplomatic path.

## Room 6 — The Herald's Dais

*The heart of the Court. A dais of white stone under an oak tree so large its branches form a cathedral. Moonlight falls through the leaves in silver shafts. On the dais stands a figure of terrible beauty — tall, antlered, wearing armor of woven moonlight. Its eyes are the gold of autumn leaves, and its smile is the last warm day before winter.*

**"Mortal. You walk in the Court of Antlers. Speak your purpose, and speak it true — we suffer no lies in this place."**

**Encounter:** 1 Court Herald attended by 2 Thorn Sprites and 1 Antler Knight. The Herald prefers to talk but fights with lethal grace if provoked. Its Proclamation ability (binding command) is its opening move in combat. It targets the party leader. The Moonfire attack illuminates hidden characters, preventing ambush tactics.

### Resolution Paths

**Fight:** Defeat the Court Herald and its retinue. This is the hardest combat option of any myth-site — the Herald is a mini-boss with support. Iron weapons are essential (instant-kill on Thorn Sprites, bypass Antler Knight armor). Victory drives the fey deeper into the valley. Omen resets to 0 but the fey are not destroyed — they nurse their grudge. The Court may reform at higher omen levels with greater hostility.

**Bargain:** The Herald offers terms. It wants a champion — someone to serve the Court for a year and a day. This can be the player character (campaign changes drastically), an NPC volunteer, or a compromise (service for a month, or a series of quests performed for the Court). Every bargain has a cost. The Herald negotiates fairly but ruthlessly. Presence (Persuasion) check, Difficulty 15 to get favorable terms. Success reduces the omen by 3. Complete fulfillment of the bargain resets omen to 0.

**Fulfill the Pact:** Find a descendant of Greenmere (an NPC in Thornwall or elsewhere — the GM places this hook) or declare oneself champion voluntarily with the Locket of Greenmere as proof of intent. Sit the antler throne in Room 3 and swear the oath. The champion serves the Court through a series of three quests (fey tasks, woven into future sessions). Upon completion, the pact is restored. Omen resets to 0, the valley is protected again, and the Court becomes an ally — offering sanctuary, information, and a **Moonsilver Blade** (longsword, +1 damage, deals radiant damage to undead and fiends, glows in the presence of lies — Legendary quality).

### If Left Alone

The valley grows strange. Thorn Sprites lure travelers off paths. At omen 3+, Antler Knights ride the borders of Greenmere, challenging anyone who enters. At omen 5, fey glamour spreads — illusions plague the valley, and people go missing. At omen 6, the Wild Hunt rides — the Court Herald leads a mounted host across the Pale Reach, taking one mortal each night until the debt is paid.
