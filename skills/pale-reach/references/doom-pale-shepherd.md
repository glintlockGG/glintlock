# The Pale Shepherd's Domain

**Location:** Hex 0602 (The Fenway) | **Danger:** Risky | **Doom:** Pale Shepherd (Portent 0-6)
**Theme:** Death as mercy or prison, the boundary between rest and oblivion, fog and forgetting

The Domain is a flooded temple half-sunk into the Fenway marshes. Once a shrine where the dead were prepared for passage, it has become a gathering place for lost souls. The Pale Shepherd — an entity of unclear origin — dwells at its heart. It may be a corrupted death-priest, a grief-born spirit, or something older. Its nature depends on what the party discovers inside.

---

## Room 1 — The Fog Gate

*The marsh thickens into a wall of white fog so dense it has weight. Sounds die within it — your own footsteps become distant, muffled things. Stone pillars emerge from the mire, carved with funerary symbols. Between them, a flagstone path descends into water that reaches your ankles, then your knees. Ahead, the outline of a structure.*

**Contents:** A sunken causeway leading to the temple entrance. The fog is supernatural — visibility is reduced to Close range. Torches burn at half effectiveness (tick countdown dice twice per exploration turn while in the Domain).
**Hazard:** Straying from the flagstone path means sinking into bog. Vigor (Athletics) check, Difficulty 12 to pull free. Failure means sinking to waist-depth — requires an ally's help or a rope.
**Encounter:** 2 Lost Pilgrims drift through the fog, weeping. They do not attack unless touched or blocked. Their Lament ability draws characters off the path.

## Room 2 — The Nave of Whispers

*The temple interior is knee-deep in dark water. Columns rise from the flood, carved with the names of the dead — thousands of them, floor to ceiling. Candles float on the water's surface, lit by no visible hand. Each one drifts toward the far end of the nave, where a doorway glows with pale light.*

**Contents:** The candles represent souls in transit. Each bears a name scratched into the wax. A character can read names — some are recent (people who died in the Pale Reach within living memory). Lore (History) check, Difficulty 9 to recognize a name from Thornwall's records or a character's backstory. This is an emotional beat, not a mechanical one.
**Hazard:** The water is icy. Each exploration turn spent wading requires a Vigor (Endurance) check, Difficulty 9, or take 1 damage from cold. Waterproof boots or a warming spell negates this.

## Room 3 — The Confession Pool

*A circular basin sunk into the temple floor, deeper than the surrounding flood — chest-high water that glows faintly from below. Stone benches ring the pool, and on each bench sits a motionless figure. Not corpses. Not alive. Waiting.*

**Contents:** 6 figures sit on the benches — souls trapped between death and rest. They are aware but passive. Speaking to them reveals fragments: each died with unfinished business. One was a soldier who deserted. One was a mother searching for a lost child. One was a thief who stole something sacred. They cannot move on because the Shepherd holds them.
**Puzzle:** Learning three or more of their stories and resolving their regrets (through conversation, promises, or symbolic acts) weakens the Shepherd's hold. Each resolved soul reduces the Shepherd's Herald's HP by 2 in the final encounter. A Presence (Persuasion) check, Difficulty 12, is needed per soul.

## Room 4 — The Drowned Sacristy

*A side chamber where the ceiling has partially collapsed, letting marsh water cascade in. Rotting shelves hold funeral vestments, ceremonial oils, and a silver aspergillum corroded green. Something moves in the water — a shape that is not quite a fish.*

**Contents:** Supplies for the old death-rites. The silver aspergillum is still functional as a holy symbol (worth 8 gp, and counts as a silver weapon in Close range, d4 damage). The ceremonial oil (3 flasks) burns with white flame — radiant damage to undead, d6 per flask, thrown at Near range.
**Encounter:** 2 Fog Wraiths lurk in the flooded section. They solidify from the water when a character reaches for the aspergillum. Fighting in chest-deep water imposes disadvantage on melee attacks.
**Treasure:** Behind a collapsed shelf: a waterproof scroll case containing a **Scroll of Banishment** (single use, forces one undead creature to make a Resolve check, Difficulty 15, or be destroyed — Fabulous quality).

## Room 5 — The Bell Tower

*A narrow stair spirals upward — the only dry ground in the temple. At the top, a bronze bell hangs in an open belfry above the fog. The bell's clapper is wrapped in black cloth, silenced. From here, you can see the fog stretching in every direction, and below it, faint lights moving — dozens of them, converging on the temple.*

**Contents:** The bell once rang to guide the dead to rest. It has been silenced. Unwrapping the clapper and ringing the bell forces all undead in the Domain to make a check or be stunned for 1 round. It also disperses the fog in the Bell Tower room permanently, creating a safe zone.
**Puzzle:** The bell can be rung once per encounter. Ringing it three times total (across the entire dungeon visit) completes the old rite of passage and allows all trapped souls to move on — this is the fulfillment resolution path.

## Room 6 — The Shepherd's Sanctum

*The deepest chamber. The water here is black and perfectly still, reflecting nothing. At the far end, a figure stands on a stone dais — tall, robed in grey, face hidden beneath a deep cowl. A shepherd's crook of pale bone rests in one hand. Around it, Lost Pilgrims kneel in the water, motionless. It raises its head as you enter. The voice is the sound of a funeral bell struck once, far away.*

**"You have come to the place between. What do you seek — passage, or power?"**

**Encounter:** 1 Shepherd's Herald with 3 Lost Pilgrims kneeling in attendance. The Pilgrims do not fight unless the Herald commands them. The Herald fights with spectral scythe and Death Knell — in the confined, flooded space, Death Knell is devastating.

### Resolution Paths

**Destroy It:** Kill the Shepherd's Herald. On death, the fog lifts across the entire Fenway for one full day, and all Lost Pilgrims in the Domain dissolve peacefully. Portent resets to 0. However, the dead have nowhere to go — without a guide, restless undead may appear elsewhere in the Pale Reach over time. The temple goes dark and silent.

**Bargain:** The Shepherd offers a deal — it will reduce its influence (portent drops by 3) in exchange for a service. It wants a specific soul brought to the Domain (an NPC who cheated death, or a ghost haunting another location). Completing the bargain does not end the doom but keeps it in check. The Shepherd honors its word precisely and literally.

**Fulfill the Rite:** Ring the bell tower bell three times and resolve the trapped souls in the Confession Pool. This completes the old death-rite the temple was built for. The Shepherd's purpose is fulfilled — it was never malevolent, only bound to duty in a broken shrine. It bows, the crook clatters to the dais, and the fog lifts permanently. Portent resets to 0. The crook becomes a **Staff of Passage** (staff, d6 damage, +1 to Commune checks, undead must make a check to approach the wielder — Fabulous quality).

### If Left Alone

Fog spreads from the Fenway. Lost Pilgrims appear on roads at night. At portent 3+, the fog reaches adjacent hexes and travelers go missing. At portent 5, a Shepherd's Herald appears outside the Domain, collecting souls. At portent 6, permanent supernatural fog blankets half the Pale Reach — navigation becomes nearly impossible, and the dead walk openly.
