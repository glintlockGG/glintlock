# Thornwall — Home Base

A fortified waystation at the center of the Pale Reach (hex 0403). Built on a low hill in the Wolds, surrounded by a timber palisade reinforced with stone at the base. Population ~80 — soldiers, tradespeople, refugees, and the desperate. The last outpost of civilization before the wilderness takes over completely.

**Atmosphere:** Smoke from the forge. Mud between the buildings. The creak of the watch platform in the wind. Everyone here is tired, cold, and holding on. But they hold.

## Locations

### 1. Warden's Hall
*A squat stone building at the center of Thornwall. Maps and reports cover a long table. The hearth is always lit. Commander Vess's desk sits beneath a faded banner.*

- **Function:** Garrison headquarters, bounty board, regional command
- **Bounty Board:** 3-5 active postings at any time. Common jobs: road patrol, threat elimination, scouting, supply escort, investigation
- **Services:** Commander Vess assigns missions, pays bounties, and shares intelligence. The regional map on the wall shows discovered hexes.

### 2. The Mended Flask
*A low-ceilinged tavern built from reclaimed timber. The floor is sticky. The fire is warm. Corvin Half-Tooth leans behind the bar, polishing the same glass he's been polishing for an hour.*

- **Function:** Tavern, inn, social hub, rumor source
- **Services:** Meals (1 sp), bed (2 sp/night), ale (5 cp). Corvin trades rumors for coin or favors — use `roll_oracle` with "rumors" table.
- **Rooms:** 4 private rooms upstairs, a common room with straw pallets

### 3. The Stacks
*A cramped building packed floor to ceiling with books, scrolls, and curios. Maren Sable sits cross-legged on a pile of manuscripts, reading by candlelight.*

- **Function:** Library, arcanist's workshop, identification services
- **Services:** Identify magic items (10 gp, takes 1 day), buy/sell scrolls, research lore. Maren can answer questions about the myths, the old world, and the region's history.
- **Special:** Maren is looking for artifacts from the old world — she'll pay double for recovered books, scrolls, or inscriptions

### 4. Root Cellar
*A whitewashed stone building with a heavy oak door. The smell of dried herbs and rendered fat. Sister Efa moves between hanging bundles, grinding something in a mortar.*

- **Function:** Apothecary, healer, spiritual counsel
- **Services:** Healing herbs (3 gp for 3 uses), surgeon's kits (10 gp), antitoxins (5 gp). Sister Efa can heal wounds (restore full HP for 5 gp, takes 1 hour). She also buys herbs gathered from the Fenway (5 gp per bundle).
- **Special:** Sister Efa knows something about the Pale Shepherd — she won't share it easily

### 5. The Undercroft
*A sealed iron door in the foundation beneath Warden's Hall. Bolted shut. Scratched from the inside. Nobody talks about it.*

- **Function:** Sealed dungeon entrance — opens when the Undercroft progress clock completes
- **Current state:** Sealed. Strange sounds at night. Scratching. Commander Vess has forbidden investigation.
- **When it opens:** A dungeon beneath Thornwall itself — contents determined by which myths have been confronted and what the player has done

## Key NPCs

### Commander Alara Vess
- **Role:** Garrison commander, quest-giver, authority figure
- **Personality:** Pragmatic, exhausted, fiercely loyal to Thornwall. Speaks in clipped sentences. Doesn't waste words.

- **Wants:** Threats eliminated, roads secured, morale maintained. Will hire the PC for dangerous work.

### Corvin "Half-Tooth"
- **Role:** Tavern keeper, information broker, social connector
- **Personality:** Wiry, missing a front tooth, knowing grin. Speaks in half-finished sentences. Implies more than he says.

- **Wants:** Profit and entertainment. Trades information for coin, favors, or good stories.

### Maren Sable
- **Role:** Scholar, arcanist, curator of old-world knowledge
- **Personality:** Intense, distracted, brilliant. Forgets to eat. Talks too fast about subjects she loves. Talks not at all about herself.
- **Knows:** The myths — their histories, their patterns, their connections. The old world and what destroyed it. Magic theory.

### Sister Efa
- **Role:** Healer, herbalist, spiritual guide
- **Personality:** Calm, patient, with kind eyes that have seen terrible things. Moves slowly and deliberately. Speaks softly.
- **Knows:** Herbal medicine, the Fenway's flora, the Pale Shepherd myth (more than she admits). Has a past connection to the marshes.
- **Wants:** To protect Thornwall's people. To keep something buried. She fears the Pale Shepherd is not what people think it is.

### Sergeant Brenn
- **Role:** Wall guard captain, veteran soldier
- **Personality:** Gruff, reliable, scarred. Does his duty without complaint. Respects competence.
- **Knows:** The perimeter, patrol routes, recent attacks, guard schedules. Which soldiers are reliable and which are close to breaking.
