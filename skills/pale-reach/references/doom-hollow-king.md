# The Hollow King's Barrow

**Location:** Hex 0501 (The Wolds) | **Danger:** Risky | **Doom:** Hollow King (Portent 0-6)
**Theme:** Undead sovereignty, unfinished grief, the weight of broken oaths

The barrow is a stone-lined burial mound sunk into the windswept Wolds. Three standing stones mark the entrance — one cracked, one leaning, one etched with a name worn smooth by centuries. Inside, the air is tomb-cold and still. The Hollow King was a warlord-protector who died betrayed by his own court. He refuses to stay dead because an oath sworn to him was never honored.

---

## Room 1 — The Mouth

*Cold air breathes out of the hillside like the exhalation of something vast and patient. Three standing stones frame a low doorway half-choked with earth. Beyond, stone steps descend into perfect darkness. The smell is dry dust and old iron.*

**Contents:** Entrance passage, 30 feet of rough-cut stone steps. Torch sconces on the walls (empty). Faint scrape marks on the floor — something has been dragged in recently.
**Hazard:** The fourth step from the bottom is a pressure plate. Triggers a stone block that seals the entrance for 1d4 hours. Wits (Awareness or Tinker) check, Difficulty 12 to spot; Reflex check, Difficulty 12 to dodge.

## Room 2 — Hall of the Sworn

*A long gallery lined with alcoves, each holding a standing corpse in corroded armor. Their empty eye sockets face the center of the hall. Tattered banners hang from the ceiling — the heraldry is a crowned skull on a field of black.*

**Contents:** 12 alcoves with preserved dead. These are the king's sworn guard. Only 4 are animate.
**Encounter:** 2 Barrow Wights patrol the hall. They ignore characters who carry no metal weapons (the king's guard only fought armed foes). Drawing steel triggers attack.
**Treasure:** One alcove holds a silver torc (15 gp) around a corpse's neck. Removing it wakes a third Barrow Wight from the nearest alcove.

## Room 3 — The Oathstone Chamber

*A circular room with a cracked stone plinth at its center. Words are carved into the plinth in an old script, half-obscured by dried blood. The walls are covered in tally marks — hundreds of them, scratched by fingernails.*

**Contents:** The Oathstone records the original pact — a neighboring lord swore to protect the king's bloodline in exchange for military aid. The oath was broken. Lore (History) check, Difficulty 12 to translate the inscription. This is the key to the diplomatic resolution.
**Hazard:** Reading the oath aloud causes the temperature to drop. All torches flicker (tick torch countdown dice immediately). The Hollow King is listening.

## Room 4 — The Cold Gallery

*Ice rimes every surface despite the season above. Your breath crystallizes. Frost-covered bones litter the floor — adventurers who came before you, frozen mid-stride. Something moves at the far end, dragging metal across stone.*

**Contents:** A frozen corridor connecting the upper barrow to the throne level. The bones are previous delvers.
**Encounter:** 2 Hollow Knights stand guard at the far door. They fight in the narrow corridor (no flanking possible). Their Grave Cold ability stacks — two hits means disadvantage on the next two attacks.
**Hazard:** The floor is treacherous ice. Running or charging requires a Reflex (Acrobatics) check, Difficulty 9, or fall prone.

## Room 5 — The Treasury

*Behind a frozen iron door, a small vault glitters with frost-covered offerings. Gold coins, gem-studded chalices, a sword laid across an altar. Everything arranged with funereal precision.*

**Contents:** The king's grave goods. Worth approximately 80 gp total (coins, jewelry, two gold chalices). The sword on the altar is **Oathkeeper** (longsword, +1 damage, glows faintly blue near oath-breakers — Fabulous quality).
**Hazard:** Taking any treasure without the king's permission (see Room 7) triggers a curse — disadvantage on all Resolve checks until the items are returned or the doom is resolved.

## Room 6 — The Bone Shepherd's Sanctum

*A side chamber thick with the smell of grave earth. Bones are stacked in careful pyramids. At the center, a robed figure stands motionless, gripping a staff made from a human spine. Its eye sockets burn with pale blue fire.*

**Encounter:** 1 Bone Shepherd with 4 Skeletons already raised. The Bone Shepherd attempts to raise 1d4 more on its first turn. Destroying it collapses all raised skeletons. This is the hardest optional fight in the barrow.
**Treasure:** The Bone Shepherd wears an **Amulet of Last Breath** (see treasure skill). It also carries a journal fragment revealing the name of the oath-breaking lord's descendant — useful for the diplomatic resolution.

## Room 7 — The Throne of the Hollow King

*A vast domed chamber lit by pale foxfire clinging to the walls. At its center, a stone throne. On the throne sits a figure in rusted crown and shattered armor, one gauntleted hand resting on a notched sword. Its eyes open as you enter — two points of cold blue light in a desiccated face. It speaks, and the voice is the sound of wind through empty halls.*

**"You stand in the hall of one betrayed. Speak your purpose, or join my court."**

**Encounter:** The Hollow King — use Wight stats but with HP 14, Armor 2, Attack d10 (king's blade). Retains Life Drain and Command Dead. Additionally: once per encounter, issues a **Royal Command** — one target in Near must make a Resolve (Fortitude) check, Difficulty 15, or kneel (lose next turn). All undead in the barrow answer his call — if rooms 2, 4, and 6 were not cleared, reinforcements arrive in 1d4 rounds.

### Resolution Paths

**Combat:** Defeat the Hollow King. His crown shatters on death, releasing a blast of cold (d6 to all in Near). All undead in the barrow collapse. The doom portent resets to 0. The barrow goes silent — permanently.

**Destroy the Crown:** The crown can be targeted directly (HP 4, Armor 0). Destroying it while the king still stands causes him to crumble — no final cold blast, and the king's spirit whispers thanks before fading. Portent resets to 0.

**Hear His Grievance:** If the party reads the Oathstone (Room 3) and speaks to the king, he explains the broken pact. He wants the oath honored — the descendant of the oath-breaker (an NPC in Thornwall or elsewhere, GM's choice) must come to the barrow and swear the oath anew. If the party arranges this, the king rests voluntarily. Portent resets to 0, and the king gifts Oathkeeper from the treasury with his blessing (no curse).

### If Left Alone

Each session the barrow is ignored, the Hollow King's influence spreads. Barrow Wights begin appearing in Wolds hexes. At portent 4+, Hollow Knights patrol the roads at night. At portent 6, the Hollow King marches on Thornwall with an army of the dead.
