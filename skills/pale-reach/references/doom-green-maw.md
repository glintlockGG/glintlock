# The Heart of the Green Maw

**Location:** Hex 0203 (Thornwood) | **Danger:** Risky | **Doom:** Green Maw (Portent 0-6)
**Theme:** Corruption, hunger, nature twisted against itself, stolen birthright

The Heart is a massive tree at the center of a corrupted grove deep in Thornwood. Its canopy blots out the sky. Its roots have spread for miles, drinking the life from the surrounding forest. The tree was once a sacred grove-warden — corrupted when a relic was stolen from its roots centuries ago. It wants the relic back. Until then, it feeds.

## Room 1 — The Dying Ring

*The forest changes. Healthy trees give way to grey, leafless trunks strangled by black-thorned vines. The undergrowth is a carpet of dead leaves and pallid fungus. Something rustles beneath the mulch — a sound like fingers drumming on wood. The air tastes of rot.*

**Contents:** A 200-foot ring of dead forest surrounding the heart-grove. The ground is soft and treacherous — root tendrils lurk just below the surface.
**Hazard:** Moving through the ring without caution requires a Wits (Survival) check, Difficulty 12. Failure means a root snags an ankle — Reflex check, Difficulty 9 to pull free or take d4 damage and lose movement.
**Encounter:** 3 Thornlings erupt from the mulch if the party makes noise or light. They try to herd intruders toward the heart-tree, not away from it.

## Room 2 — The Bone Garden

*Skeletal remains of animals — deer, wolves, birds — are woven into a lattice of roots, displayed like trophies. Some are fresh. A few are disturbingly large. At the center, a human skeleton sits upright in a cage of living wood, still wearing a leather pack.*

**Contents:** The human remains are a previous delver. The pack contains a journal describing the grove's history and mentioning the stolen relic — a **Heartstone** (a fist-sized green gem taken by prospectors). Lore (History) check, Difficulty 9 to piece together the journal's water-damaged entries.
**Treasure:** The pack also holds 12 gp in mixed coins, a potion of healing (restores d6+2 HP), and an iron hatchet (d6 weapon — useful because fire and iron are effective here).

## Room 3 — The Thornling Nest

*A hollow formed by interlocking roots, warm and humid. Dozens of small humanoid shapes hang from the ceiling like seed pods — Thornlings in various stages of growth. Some twitch. The floor writhes with pale rootlets.*

**Contents:** A nursery. 8 dormant Thornlings hang from the root-ceiling. They activate in pairs every 2 rounds if disturbed.
**Encounter:** Starts with 2 Thornlings. Reinforcements of 2 more arrive each subsequent round for up to 4 rounds. Fire destroys the pods instantly (all dormant Thornlings die without activating), but the smoke alerts the Maw Tendril in Room 5.
**Hazard:** The rootlets on the floor attempt to entangle anyone standing still. Reflex check, Difficulty 9, at the end of each turn spent stationary in this room.

## Room 4 — The Sap Pool

*A clearing where black sap has pooled into a shallow basin between root buttresses. The sap glows faintly green. Insects land on its surface and dissolve. The sweet smell is overwhelming — and underneath it, something like a voice, whispering in a language older than words.*

**Contents:** The sap is the heart-tree's lifeblood, pumped up from roots that reach deep underground. It is toxic to touch (d4 acid damage) but valuable as an alchemical reagent (3 doses, worth 10 gp each).
**Puzzle:** A character with Lore (Arcana) training who listens to the whispers can make a check, Difficulty 15. Success reveals the tree's desire — it repeats "return what was taken" in a pre-human tongue. This is the key to the diplomatic path.
**Hazard:** Drinking the sap forces a Vigor (Endurance) check, Difficulty 15. Failure: d8 poison damage. Success: gain advantage on all Survival checks in Thornwood for 24 hours as the forest recognizes you.

## Room 5 — The Root Veil

*A curtain of hanging roots, thick as arms, blocks the passage forward. Beyond it you glimpse green light pulsing like a heartbeat. The roots flex and contract rhythmically. Something massive moves on the other side.*

**Encounter:** 1 Root Horror guards this passage. It uses Entangle to prevent passage while 2 Thornlings flank from behind (emerging from the walls). The Root Horror will not pursue beyond this room — it is tethered here.
**Shortcut:** A character small enough (Goblin ancestry, or anyone willing to crawl) can find a gap in the root wall. Reflex (Acrobatics) check, Difficulty 12 to squeeze through without alerting the Root Horror.

## Room 6 — The Heart Chamber

*The heart-tree fills the sky. Its trunk is fifty feet across, bark split and weeping black sap. Bioluminescent fungus coats every surface in sickly green. At the base of the trunk, a hollow — a wound in the wood where something was pried free long ago. The roots around it pulse and grasp at nothing. The entire grove trembles with the tree's hunger.*

**Encounter:** 1 Maw Tendril (the tree's physical defense system). It fights from the trunk, using crushing vine to grapple and thorn spray to punish groups. The tree itself has HP 30, Armor 0, and does not attack — it relies on the Tendril. If the Tendril is destroyed, the tree is defenseless.

### Resolution Paths

**Burn It:** Fire deals double damage to both the Tendril and the tree. If the tree reaches 0 HP by fire, the entire grove ignites — the party has 3 rounds to escape the Dying Ring before the fire spreads. Portent resets to 0. The surrounding Thornwood begins recovering within weeks, but a massive dead zone remains.

**Return the Heartstone:** If the party finds and returns the Heartstone (a quest that may involve tracking it to a collector, merchant, or another dungeon), placing it in the hollow at the tree's base heals the corruption instantly. The Maw Tendril goes dormant. The tree's canopy blooms green. Portent resets to 0, and the tree gifts a **Rootshield** (see treasure skill) grown from its own wood.

**Purge the Corruption:** An Invoker or Seer can attempt to cleanse the tree directly. This requires casting a healing or purification spell into the hollow while maintaining concentration for 3 rounds. Each round, the Maw Tendril attacks. Lore (Arcana) or Resolve (Commune) check, Difficulty 15, each round — three successes purges the corruption. Portent resets to 0.

### If Left Alone

The Thornwood darkens. Thornlings appear on forest paths. At portent 3+, Root Horrors block the roads through Thornwood. At portent 5, the tree's roots reach Thornwall's foundations. At portent 6, the Green Maw swallows a hex of forest entirely — everything living in it dies, and a Maw Tendril sprouts at every crossroads.
