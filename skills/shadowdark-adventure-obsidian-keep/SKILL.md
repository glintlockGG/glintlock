# Raiding the Obsidian Keep

An adventure for level 2-4, playable in several sessions. Originally written for OSE by Joseph R. Lewis, adapted here for Shadowdark RPG. Emphasizes exploration, mystery-solving, and social encounters, with opportunities for combat (always risky).

## Background

On the subterranean shores of the Sakeen Sea stands the holy city of Radiant Vitela. In the center of the sea lies Isla Requia, where the lords of the Obsidian Keep harass passing ships with their magics. Duchess Forza mastered sorcery. Her husband Duke Avito grew jealous of her power.

One year ago, the Archbishop of Radiant Vitela secretly sent the red priests of Vermesh to seduce and corrupt Duke Avito. Two weeks ago, the Archbishop sent a fleet of holy warships to destroy the Obsidian Keep. The fleet never returned.

During the attack, Duke Avito sacrificed his youngest daughter Bianca to summon the immortal horror Vermesh. The half-completed ritual caused a "red storm" of Chaos energy, destroying the fleet and devastating the Obsidian Keep. The Duke fumbled the knife and Vermesh bit off his arm (fatal). Bianca was left in limbo with a crystal knife in her heart.

**Today:** Shattered fleet in the harbor. Survivors huddle on the beach. Inside the Keep, a nightmare of mutations, chaos, and undeath. Duchess Forza lies mostly dead. Duke Avito is entirely dead. Vermesh lurks ethereally, waiting to complete the ritual.

## Adventure Hooks

1. **Archbishop's Call** (Lawful): Sail to Isla Requia and learn the fate of the fleet. Rewards for saving sailors (50 GP each), recovering relics (500 GP each), and proof that Duke Avito and Duchess Forza are dead (5,000 GP each).
2. **Treasure Hunter** (Chaotic): Master Argento wants treasure hunters to recover valuables. Rewards for eye witnesses (25 GP each), weapons (250 GP each), Obsidian Keep rarities (1,000 GP each), items belonging to the Duke/Duchess (5,000 GP each).

## Ending the Adventure

**If Vermesh is not defeated**: Chaos spreads. Lovely horrors and humans mutate further into demonic creatures. Island declared a hazard.

**If Vermesh is defeated**: Chaos fades. Monsters retreat. Lovely horrors weaken. Survivors beg passage to mainland. Obsidian Keep stands empty until another cult or pirates move in.

**If either princess survives**: They take up a lifelong pilgrimage bolstering Law and opposing Chaos. Their exploits become legendary.

**In any case**: The Archbishop uses the tragedy to keep the people faithful and subservient.
