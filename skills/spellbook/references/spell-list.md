# Invoker Spells

## Tier 1

**Arcane Bolt** — Far. Instant. Hurl a crackling shard of raw magic at one visible target. Deals 1d6 damage. Advantage on the spell check (the bolt is easy to shape but hard to aim precisely).

**Detect Magic** — Near. Sustained. Sense the presence and school of magic within near range. Sustain for a full turn to discern specific properties of one magical object or effect. Blocked by stone thicker than a hand's width.

**Feather Fall** — Self. Instant. Cast when you or an ally within close range begins falling. The target drifts safely to the ground, taking no falling damage.

**Flame Burst** — Close. Instant. A ring of fire erupts outward from your body, filling the close area around you. Deals 1d6 damage to all creatures in the area. Flammable objects ignite.

**Light** — Close. cd8 turns. Touch one object. It glows with pale arcane light, illuminating near distance. The light is cold and cannot ignite anything.

**Arcane Ward** — Self. cd6 turns. Shimmering plates of force orbit your body, granting 2 Armor. On a critical cast, grants 3 Armor instead.

**Shield** — Self. Instant. Cast as a reaction when attacked. Gain +3 Armor against that single attack. If the attack still hits, the shield shatters with a sound like breaking glass.

**Sleep** — Near. Instant. A wave of drowsiness rolls outward in a near-sized area. Living creatures of level 2 or lower fall into deep, dreamless sleep. Loud noise or injury wakes them. Higher-level creatures feel drowsy but resist.

**Hold Portal** — Near. cd8 turns. Seal one door, gate, or portal with invisible force. It cannot be opened by mundane means. A creature can force it with a Vigor check contested against your spell check result.

**Beguile** — Near. cd6 turns. One humanoid of level 2 or lower regards you as a trusted friend. The target acts naturally but favors your suggestions. Ends immediately if you or your allies harm the target. The target remembers everything afterward.

## Tier 2

**Invisibility** — Close. cd8 turns. Touch one willing creature. It becomes invisible along with everything it carries. Ends immediately if the target attacks, casts a spell, or takes damage.

**Mirror Image** — Self. cd6 turns. Illusory duplicates appear around you (number equal to half your level, minimum 1). Each attack directed at you destroys one duplicate instead of hitting you. When the last duplicate is destroyed, the spell ends.

**Levitate** — Self. Sustained. Rise or descend up to near distance vertically each turn. You drift in place unless you push against a solid surface to move horizontally. Wind affects you normally.

**Lightning Bolt** — Far. Instant. A jagged arc of electricity leaps from your fingertip to one visible target. Deals 2d6 damage. If the target is wearing metal armor, deals 3d6 instead. The thunder is audible at far range and triggers encounter checks.

**Web** — Far. cd6 turns. Sticky, ropey strands fill a near-sized area. Creatures caught inside cannot move. A creature can tear free with a Vigor check (Difficulty equals your spell check result). The web is flammable -- fire destroys it in one turn but deals 1d4 damage to anyone trapped inside.

**Blink Step** — Self. Instant. Vanish and reappear at any point within near range that you can see. You pass through solid barriers but not magical ones. A faint afterimage lingers where you stood.

**Knock** — Near. Instant. One locked door, chest, gate, or sealed portal within near range springs open, defeating all mundane locks and bars. Magical seals require a contested spell check. The spell produces a thunderous knock audible throughout the area.

**Silence** — Far. Sustained. An invisible sphere of silence fills a near-sized area. No sound can be created or heard within it. Creatures inside cannot cast spells that require spoken words. Sustaining this spell requires no verbal component.

## Tier 3

**Fireball** — Far. Instant. A bead of fire streaks from your hand and detonates at a point within far range. All creatures in a near-sized area take 3d6 fire damage. Flammable objects ignite. The explosion is visible and audible for miles.

**Dispel Magic** — Near. Instant. End one magical effect on a creature or object within near range. If the effect was cast by a higher-level caster, make a contested spell check against the original caster's result (or Difficulty 15 if the original result is unknown).

**Wall of Force** — Near. cd6 turns. An invisible wall of solid force appears at a point within near range. The wall is up to near distance long and twice a person's height. Nothing physical can pass through it. It can be shaped into a dome or curve. Dispel Magic destroys it.

**Dominate** — Near. Sustained. Seize control of one humanoid of level 4 or lower. The target obeys your spoken commands. Each turn, the target may attempt a Resolve check (Difficulty equals your spell check result) to break free. If you order the target to harm itself or its allies, it gets advantage on the check.

# Seer Spells

## Tier 1

**Mend Flesh** — Close. Instant. Touch one creature and channel restorative energy. Restore 1d6 HP. On a critical cast, restore 2d6 HP instead.

**Spirit Sight** — Self. Sustained. Your eyes glow faintly. You can see invisible creatures, hidden undead, and the residue of recent magic within near range. You also perceive emotional impressions -- fear, anger, grief -- lingering in places where strong events occurred.

**Sanctuary** — Close. cd6 turns. Touch one willing creature. Enemies must pass a Resolve check (Difficulty equals your spell check result) before they can target the warded creature with attacks or hostile effects. Ends if the warded creature attacks or casts a hostile spell.

**Turn Undead** — Near. Instant. Hold forth your holy symbol and speak a word of banishment. All undead within near range must make a Resolve check (contested against your spell check). Failure: they flee for cd6 turns. If they are level 2 or lower and you beat their check by 5+, they are destroyed.

**Warding Light** — Close. cd8 turns. One object you touch radiates warm, steady light illuminating near distance. Undead and shadow-creatures within the light have disadvantage on attacks. The light cannot be suppressed by magical darkness of Tier 2 or lower.

## Tier 2

**Augury** — Self. Instant. Describe a specific course of action you intend to take in the near future. The GM answers with one word: "Weal" (good outcome likely), "Woe" (bad outcome likely), or "Murky" (unclear or mixed). The answer reflects the most probable outcome, not certainty.

**Bless** — Close. Instant. Touch one creature. It gains a luck token. The token can be spent to reroll any one check (must accept the new result). Only one blessing can be active on a creature at a time.

**Commune** — Self. Instant. Enter a brief trance and pose three yes-or-no questions to the spirits or your patron. The GM answers each truthfully, though answers may be cryptic. Using this spell more than once between long rests yields increasingly unreliable answers.

**Banish** — Near. Sustained. Target one extraplanar, summoned, or undead creature of level 4 or lower. It is hurled back to its plane of origin or destroyed if it has no native plane. While you sustain, the target is paralyzed and fading. If you lose concentration before the spell completes (3 full turns of sustaining), the target returns unharmed and enraged.

**Silence the Suffering** — Close. Instant. Touch one creature affected by poison, disease, or a magical curse. The condition is suppressed for cd8 turns (it does not progress or cause symptoms). This does not cure the condition -- it returns when the suppression ends.

## Tier 3

**True Seeing** — Self. cd6 turns. Your perception pierces all deception. You see through illusions, shapeshifting, invisibility, and magical darkness. You perceive the true form of all creatures and objects within near range. Hidden doors, secret writing, and disguised traps are obvious to you.

**Resurrection** — Close. Instant. Touch a creature that died within the last hour. Its death clock resets and it returns to life with 1 HP. The creature gains 1 permanent point of exhaustion that can never be removed -- a scar of having crossed the threshold. This spell can only affect a given creature once. A creature resurrected a second time returns... wrong.

**Divine Ward** — Near. cd8 turns. A shimmering dome of protective energy covers a near-sized area. Allies inside gain 2 Armor and advantage on Resolve checks. Hostile spells targeting creatures inside the ward have disadvantage. The ward is stationary once placed.

# Surgeon Preparations

## Tier 1

**Smelling Salts** — Close. Instant. A pungent vial held under the nose of an unconscious creature. The target immediately wakes and can act on its next turn. Does not restore HP, but stabilizes a dying creature (stops death clock).

**Styptic Powder** — Close. Instant. Pack a wound with caustic powder that stops bleeding instantly. Restore 1d4 HP and end any bleed effects on the target. Stings terribly -- the target has disadvantage on its next check from the pain.

**Antitoxin** — Close. Instant. A bitter draught that neutralizes poison. Ends one poison effect on the target. If administered within one turn of being poisoned, the poison never takes effect. Can be prepared in advance and stored in a vial.

**Numbing Draught** — Close. cd8 turns. A thick, chalky liquid that deadens pain. The target ignores the effects of one wound or injury (broken limb, burn, etc.) for the duration. The injury is not healed -- it returns in full when the draught wears off.

**Flash Powder** — Near. Instant. Hurl a packet that detonates in a blinding flash. All creatures within close range of the impact point must pass a Reflex check (Difficulty equals your preparation check) or be blinded for cd4 turns.

## Tier 2

**Volatile Mixture** — Near. Instant. A stoppered flask of unstable compounds. On impact, it explodes for 2d6 fire damage to all creatures within close range of the target point. The Surgeon must handle it carefully -- dropping it or taking fire damage while carrying it triggers detonation centered on the Surgeon.

**Stimulant Injection** — Close. Instant. A needle of concentrated stimulant. The target gains advantage on all checks until the end of its next turn, then suffers disadvantage on all checks for cd4 turns as the stimulant burns out. Cannot be used on the same creature twice in one day.

**Restorative Tincture** — Close. Instant. A carefully measured dose of regenerative compounds. Restore 2d6 HP to one creature. If the target is at half HP or below, restore 3d6 instead. Requires one minute of application -- cannot be used in combat.

## Tier 3

**Panacea** — Close. Instant. A masterwork curative that purges the body of all ailments. Ends all poisons, diseases, curses, and magical debilitations on one creature. Also restores 1d6 HP. Requires extremely rare ingredients -- the GM determines availability and cost.

**Surgeon's Miracle** — Close. Instant. An emergency surgical procedure performed on a creature that died within the last 3 turns. Make a preparation check (Difficulty 15). On success, the creature returns to life with 1 HP and is unconscious for cd8 turns. On failure, the body is too damaged -- nothing can bring it back. Consumes the entire Surgeon's kit regardless of outcome.

# Warden Blessings

## Tier 1

**Shield of Faith** — Self. cd6 turns. A faint shimmer surrounds your shield arm. Gain +1 Armor while wielding a shield (stacks with the shield's normal bonus). On a critical cast, the bonus applies to one adjacent ally as well.

**Bolster** — Close. cd6 turns. Touch one ally and speak a word of courage. The target has advantage on Resolve checks against fear, charm, and compulsion for the duration.

**Endure Elements** — Close. cd8 turns. Touch one creature. It is comfortable in extreme heat or cold (choose one when cast) and takes no damage from environmental temperature. Does not protect against fire or ice attacks.

**Consecrate Ground** — Close. cd8 turns. Touch the ground and sanctify a close-range area around you. Undead within the area have disadvantage on all checks. Corpses within the area cannot be animated. The consecration is stationary.

## Tier 2

**Smite** — Close. Instant. Speak a word of judgment and strike with a melee weapon. If the attack hits, deal an additional 1d8 radiant damage. Against undead or fiends, deal 2d8 additional damage instead.

**Stalwart Aura** — Self. cd6 turns. All allies within close range (including you) gain +1 Armor. This stacks with Shield of Faith but not with another Stalwart Aura.
