# Spellcasting

**To cast:** Roll d20 + INT mod (Arcanist) or d20 + WIS mod (Warden) ≥ 10 + spell tier.

| Spell Tier | DC |
|---|---|
| 1 | 11 |
| 2 | 12 |
| 3 | 13 |
| 4 | 14 |
| 5 | 15 |

**Success:** Spell takes effect.
**Failure:** Spell does not take effect. Can't cast that spell again until rest.
**Critical success (nat 20):** Double one numerical effect. Persists on focus spells until next focus check.
**Critical failure (nat 1):** Spell fails. Arcanist: lose spell until rest + roll arcane backlash table. Warden: patron revokes spell, requires tithe + rest.

## Focus Spells

Can't cast other focus spells while focusing. End focus at any time.
- Each turn: make spellcasting check to maintain.
- **Success:** Spell continues until start of next turn.
- **Failure:** Spell ends. You do NOT lose the ability to cast it.
- **Critical failure on focus check:** Treated as standard critical failure.
- **Damage/distraction while focusing:** Immediate spellcasting check to maintain.

## Tithe (Wardens)

On critical failure, patron revokes spell. Must complete tithe + rest to regain.
- Tier 1: 5 gp sacrifice, Tier 2: 20 gp, Tier 3: 40 gp, Tier 4: 90 gp, Tier 5: 150 gp
- Inadequate or subversive tithe makes the spell loss permanent.

## Scrolls and Wands

Spellcasters can use scrolls/wands if the spell is on their spell list (even if unknown).
DC: 10 + spell tier. Failing doesn't affect known spells.

- **Scroll:** Writing disappears after attempt (success or fail). Critical failure: arcane backlash.
- **Wand:** Stops working until rest on fail. Critical failure: permanently breaks + arcane backlash.
